Travelling usually means getting on a train, bus or occasional plane. Well, not this time. The plane was just the beginning, to get to Kathmandu. Thats where it all started. Driving in Kathmandu calls for commando-like survival skills to maneuver among legions of motorcycle drivers, who squirm left and right and everywhere to beat the stalled traffic. Local drivers also use the horn as signal of right-of-way. There are no drive-yourself rental cars available in Nepal, but you can easily hire a car or jeep with a driver through a travel agency. We have booked a private car to wait there for us. It took us 10 hours to drive ca. 200km to Chame. As one of the fellow tourist described the trafic "after 2 hours in the car we still weren't sure which side of the road do Nepali drive on". Although it may seem chaotic, this style of driving doesn’t cause conflict or frequent accidents on the roads. Generally, the people remain calm and compassionate – thanks to the Buddhist and Hindu philosophy. 

After a couple hours drive, we swapt the car for a jeep in Basisahar. The jeep is required for the second part of the journey because there is only a narrow dirt road. The weather there makes it difficult to maintain roads a good shape.  Avoid doing this during the monsoon season.Rrains cause landslides and make driving and using the roads risky and dangerous. The famous death road in Peru is luxerious in comparison to our journey from Basishar to Chame. Chachare kohl bridge was the last one we have crossed. For the rest of the way the moto "bridges are overrated" applied. Sometimes I had the feeling that our cars remains on the road just by the will power excercised by the passengers. I must admit that the ride was not my cup of tea. On the other hand Martina enjoyed it, while Juraj even slept through some of the most scary parts. The locals don't seem to mind the roads at all. It's quite common to see a 5 seater car with 10 passengers. 

Unfortunatelly, We didn't make it to Chame as we planned: a truck got stuck on the road which caused a delay. Therefore we stayed in Dharaphani in a regular teahouse. however the beds were damp for some reason, so we slep on the emergency foils - pretty smart idea Juraj came up with. There was also a toilet and shower with "hot" (translate as luke warm) water. You should be prepare for overpriced tea in all the tea houses. 

If you plan a similar trip, we would recommend you to stay in one of the tea houses in Namala - it's just a little further up, much less touristy and you get a great view of the Manansula.
