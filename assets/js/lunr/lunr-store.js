        "excerpt":"It has been colder lately with couple of days when it was snowing. The conditions are finally good enough for an (on-piste) ski tour. The idea was to choose something short and close to Munich, so we can get to work afterwards.   We have chosen to go to Roßkopf. Leaving Munich at 6.20 to we started skinning up little past 7. We started from the parking lot next to the lift - it was almost empty and quite cold with -9°C and clear skies.   The way to the top goes along the piste. I took us around 50min to reach Roßkopf - the view is great. We took the black piste to go down. The piste was little icy, but it felt great to finally ski. On the way down we met around 10 more people going up.   Overall much recomended for early birds who want to ski before work, with almost zero natural risks. Might be a little boring for those extreme adventurers among us.

        "excerpt":"The second skitour this year started on the piste again, in Hirschberg. There is just enough snow to start the tour from the parking lot. The piste was fine on the climb but above the forest line, rocks were visible. I knew this will be tough for my skis today. Weather was better than snow conditions, clouds covered only valleys. There was clear sky with sun shining above 1200 m.a.s.l.   Rocks are visible in upper places (see 2nd picture in the gallery above). As a result, I hit few rocks on my ski down although I went through the forest to avoid the most of them. We will return here but after some snowing, it might possibly be a night ski tour (see the last picture in the gallery for details) - it is every Thursday from 18 do 22.

        "excerpt":"This is going to be a short entry of our first ski tour in Slovakia. We went to Poludnovy Grun in Ski resort Vratna-Paseky (Mala Fatra range), close to Zilina. This was an on piste ski tour. We started at the parking lot and basicallly followed the lifts all the way up. The first part was prepared by pisten bully. The second was not prepared as it was not open yet, however there was enough snow to comfortably ski down from the top of the lift. Unfortunately, we did not make it all the way to the peak because of strong wind and lack of snow on the exposed sites.   We will be coming back to Ski resort Vratna-Paseky for a ski day with the family before Christmas comes.

        "excerpt":"Yet another on piste ski tour, starting in Tatranska Lomnica skiresort. We do this ski tour at least once a year because the skiing is quite rewarding especially with fresh snow. We started our skitour quite late today, almost at noon. We still met quite a number of other skitourers.   It was quite foggy in the valley, almost milky sometimes. As we got to Skalnate pleso, we (exceptionally) took a coffee break. The restaurant has been renovated recently.   Skinning after the break was going smooth but somehow slower in the beginning. The area above Skalnate Pleso was covered by 5-10 cm recent snow, no ice and wind-blown crust seldomly. To our surprise, the top part seemed a different world - sun was shining, fog was below us and the view was amazing. The piste was not prepared and therefore closed, luckily for us, so we could enjoy some pow almost privately. We reached the top slightly above 2 hours.   Skiing down the upper part was great. The lower part on the other hand was a challange. Despite of having skied the piste so many times before, orientation was quite difficult and slopes were basicaly ice. Being doped with endorphines, we still enjoyed every part of it :).

        "excerpt":"It has been constantly snowing in Munich since yesterday. We were warned prior the weekend but who would think 20 cm of snow can cause today’s traffic. Our 50 minutes drive to Prealps region was 1 hour and 30 minutes at least (including avoiding highways with stationary traffic).   I chose Brauneck as my go-to place for today, to stay on the safe side and not home. There is more than enough snow in the forest (at least 20-30 cm), the climb was without any problems. I met some freerides in the upper forest who were searching for new lines. The weather started to be more challenging above the Panorama restaurant. The wind was throwing the icy snow to my face constantly up there.   After reaching Brauneck pit stop at Brauneck-Gipfelhaus as always. As I forgot my ski googles, I had to fight with snow flakes (reminder for the next time, ski googles are important and it can snow!). The slope was already bumpy (it was only 11 am) with plenty kids (I chose the wrong slope, my bad (: ).

        "excerpt":"Road situation was more relaxed than yesterday in South Bavaria. Today’s skitour is in Blomberg, close to Bad Tolz. I have mountainbiked here in the last year but not skitour. As we would like to start doing evening skitours this winter season, Blomberg was a good candidate to try it during the day. By the way, Tuesdays are evening skitours here !   Starting at the Blombergbahn parking lot, the track is from the left side as you are looking towards the slope. It follows the slope which is unmantained, freeride everywhere. The beginning is more flat (red ski slope), later changes to black ski slope. Once you reach the top, you follow the road until Blomberghaus (takes around 10 minutes). The restaurant is opened during the weekends this season until 6pm.   From the restaurant I skinned back to the top lift station. The downhill skiing starts ! We had lot of snow in the recent 2 days, thus was sometimes knee deep.

        "excerpt":"It’s been snowing almost the entire week, making us very happy but the situation got critical in some parts of Prealps. Lot of huts are closed due to the snow and avalanche risks. The same for few ski resorts around Munich.   Kampenwand has not been closed in the last days and we have never been there previously. Roads were fine in the morning, less than one hour drive. Parking situation suprised us. We were not allowed to park at Kampenwandbahn, no skitourers allowed. Turned around, went to Parkplazt festhalle, closed completely! We eventually found a privat spot, an owner allowed us to stay there for two hours - this is our time limit, good challenge.   Skinning up on the ski slope entirely. There are possibilities through the forest, for another time. It tooks us around 1:30h to the top lift station. It was windy, snowing and foggy. Not going further, skins off and descent. Snow was good but slushy in the lower part.   We will come back for skiing, plenty freeride possibilities and wide ski area (at least what fogs allowed us to see).

        "title": "Spitzingsee: Taubenstein skitour - Jan 19",
        "excerpt":"Second week of avalanche danger 4 in Prealps here. What can we do ? Wait, wait until we get to more stable days? After few days of waiting, here we come - 3 and going to 2 ! Ski resorts are getting back to normal, no more road closures around (few are still closed even today but much less than before). Time to find a spot for tour today? Yes!   First proposal was Wendelstein as I have seen some recent tours from there - want to see that view ! I came there early in the morning, parked my car at Wendelstein lift and look around. First notice - lot of heavy tracks, firefighters, big army trucks. This does not look good? I checked the skitour start where the map is located there to review the tour start. There is a label that skitour is not advised, avalanche danger. Snow patrol at the lift told me not to go, as they triggered some avalanches (or they will, did not fully undestand them, my german is still limited in some ways). I turned around within a second, Spitzingsee it is for today.   Taubenstein - not many cars for Friday morning. Seeing just 2 skitourers while I get a parking ticket (5 euros for parking but got 4.80 only in coins as I already paid for Wendelstein parking 3 euros. I am saved by down parking by the road). First thing I notice - LVS checkpoint - awesome ! We need more places like this. It made me realize my LVS is off, lets check. Going up, deciding to go direction Rauhkopf or Tanzeck. As I climb, I do not feel comfortable alone. I can see some slides around, it is snowing slightly and all just for me. I decided to turn above Glockenwand, time to go down to be back in morning to start my working day.   Downhill skiing passing Glockenwand - fresh snow - 5 cm, crusty sometimes but my skies went through without problems. Lower parts after I passsed Schönfeldhütte were more crusty, some bumps as a result of older tracks.   Back to the car in less than two hours, time to go back to Munich to start a working day. I am glad I did not give up after Wendelstein fiasko :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Taubenstein skitour - Jan 19       Tour info      Drive   55 minutes drive from Munich   Start   Parking lot at Taubenstein lift, 5 euros per day.

        "excerpt":"We started our skitour season on Rosskopf a month ago but from another side - Kurvenlift. We climbed most of the time on piste. This time, I was alone and decided to go through the forest. The tour starts from Stumplingbahn parking lot. Small descent on skis (I forgot about it and put my skins :-)). The climb goes through the forest half way up. As soon as the forest ends, it opens with possibilities for some freeride.   The last climb can be done via the ski slope (not much recommended as it is narrow and skiers!). I chose this way as it was early morning, slopes were already opened however but almost no one around. I met only five skiers, and one ski tourer.   Descent via ski slope 3a (rated black), it starts right below Rosskopf. The slope nicely groomed, few lines only before me. Few minutes later, skis back again to reach the parking lot. It was still quite empty to my suprise.  Another possibility for early morning skitour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          rosskopf skitour - Jan 19       Tour info      Drive   55 minutes drive from Munich   Start   Parking lot at Stumpfling lift, I paid 5 euros per day in the parking lot prior entering the Stumplfing as ski lift parking was closed early in the morning (before 8 am).

        "excerpt":"Wank was on the list as it has nice views towards Garmish and peaks surrounding it (checked the header picture here?). The forecast for today was not much promising, light snowfall with winds entire morning, cloudy in the afternoon (temperature spike - melting snow later).   Few cars only parked at Wankbahn in the morning, looks promising. It is possible to start skinning almost from the parking lot. The first third goes on the forest road. I expected poor visibility today - snowing with wind, not best combination sometimes. It starts being more steep on the way below Ameisenberg (as soon as I left the forest road). Kick turns becoming the thing too often here. There are few possibilities for freeride around - I can spot some old lines. The visibility is poor on the top, wind became much stronger on the top and continues snowing. Quick rest with lunch at Wankhaus allowed me to see Garmisch from the top - it cleared twice for a minute.   The descend goes to Esterberg, using old ski piste that is not “in use for alpine sking” anymore, available for ski tourers/freerides. I can see someone followed the road, won’t do that if there is 30 cm of fresh snow. Going straigh down until I reach Esterberg. It becomes quite flat, I should have put back my skins but was convincing myself I could do it without (few minutes of pushing with ski poles, why not). Takes about 2 kilometers to start going down wihtout any effort. I did not ski to the car parking lot as the temperature raised after noon. The road was sometimes without any snow (also some car passed and helpted it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     wank skitour - Jan 19       Tour info      Drive   1 hour 10 minutes drive from Munich, note: there are always traffic jams on the way to Garmisch.

        "excerpt":"We were not lucky having sunny weekends this month. Today was an exception! Group of people from IMG (International Munich group) organized skitour to Schönalmjoch. Thanks Katja for organizing!   The tour starts from Hinterriß village in Karwendel. We were 8 of us today, bigger group than yesterday as I went just alone :-). Skitour starts right from the parking lot. The most of the climbing is through the forest (it’s protective area all around so no shortcuts). The forest opens itself after 2 hours of climbing. As soon as the treeline ends, the summit is visible with all the lines from the top - can’t wait to draw mine!   Sun was shining all the way up. The clouds came when we reached the top. Suddenly from t-shirt, 2 more layers to keep me warm. Around 8 other people already waiting for their descent. The views are incredible if weather allows. Look around and peaks like  Glossglocker, Zugspitze.   Descent was good, round 20 cm of powdery snow. The bottom part more crusty. Once we reach the bottom part, we have to put skins back on, to climb back on track we went up (there are nature protective areas as I mentioned earlier). Then ski again until the parking lot. This part had also good snow, lot of tracks as you can see in the pictures below. Compare to yesterday with Wank skitour, the forest road goes down all the day, no need to push just keep going and making your turns.

        "excerpt":"Todays forcast was not very favorble so we have chosen an easy on-piste tour. Our dear friend Martin acompanied us. We went to a ski resort called Velka Raca and went up along piste called Laliky. We chose skitour/hiking track 15. This track ends at the top Laliky ski lift station. We continued further along the ridgeline until the peak Velka Raca, which is actually just on the boarder to Poland. The view from there is pretty good, considering it is just 1236 m.a.s.l.   The snow conditions - icy in the morning and almost spring like firn towards midday. Better than our expectations prior the tour. The hut on the polisch side (Schronisko PTTK) was opened, busy inside. We were lucky it did not rain neither winds (it started raining once we got back to Zilina).

        "excerpt":"It snowed a bit in the beginning of this week, thus I chose to do short pre-work skitour on Wednesday to check conditions prior the weekend. I started earlier today, at 7 am. Only few cars at the parking lot, good sign, I am early! As it was going to be sunny, fresh snow - more people expected later. Quite a number around 9 am there today as I was going down already.   I started with faster pace in the beginning, not good after recovering from sickness the previous week. Therefore I had to slow down. Snow conditions were clear since the beginning, it was around 15 to 20 cm of new snow. I was going alone, followed by group of 3 skitourers. They also went up to Rauhkopf. Few others went direction Tanzeck.   It took me today something over 1 hour to reach Rauhkopf, 1698 m.a.s.l. The top part was icy, packed snow hardened by wind. Looks like saddles/summits around Spitzingsee might need caution this weekend or the higher temperatures might just melt that hardened snow. As soon as I lowered by 50 meters from the summit, the skiing was more fun! Beautiful start of the day!   We should have sunny days the upcoming weekend however warmer, too much I would say for winter (weather forecast is ~10 degrees at 1500 m.a.s.l for Spintzingsee :-/).

        "title": "Spitzingsee: Rotwand weekend skitour - Feb 19",
        "excerpt":"We had visitors last weekend and planned an outdoor weekend for that occasion. The weather played along and actually surprised us: a warm front came our way and we ended up skitouring in short sleeves. We started the ski tour a little later and by the time we reached the top Rotwand it was almost 2 pm. The snow was quite heavy and skiing down was a little challenging but OK : the idea of cold beer/radler was quite the motivation.   After some refueling at the hut we went to Auerspitz to watch the sunset (we did the same in summer) - the view from there is great. The snow was already a bit crusty on the south facing slopes from Rotwandhouse towards Auerspitz. We skied down from Auerspitz in direction Großtiefentalalm and skinned back up towards Rotwandhaus. By the time we were putting our skins on it was dark, but with moonshine so bright that headlamps were not necessary. The snow was pretty great on this side - loose, granual and not too heavy (some of us actually couldn’t resist this slope and skied down from Kumpfl Scharte just to come back up again). The last traverse from Kumpfl Scharte to Rotwandhaus was a bit tricky. The tracks were worn out and icy - ski crampons worthy. We got back to the hut just in time for dinner at 7 pm. There was quite a bit of beer, liquor and laughter afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         From Spitzingsee to Rotwandhaus + Auerspitz  skitour day 1 - Feb 19       The next day was equally pleasant - spring like weather and good mood. We left after breakfast, traversed towards Kumpfl Scharte, skied direction to Großtiefentalalm and skinned up via Kleintiefentalalm to Taubensteinhaus, where we took a beer &amp; sunbathing break. From there its very close to the piste, which we took to get back to the parking lot where we started from. The last bit of the piste is the very last challenge - long, wide and very little inclined track which will most likely force you to skate or put your skins back on.   Overall, definitely recommended tour, doable in one day also. We are looking forward to return here on wheels in summer.

        "title": "Wilder Kaiser: Ellmauer Tor skitour - Feb 19",
        "excerpt":"We did not have much snowfall this week, the only day with snowflakes was Friday. The weekend was sunny again, both days. As we were skiing in Zugspitze skiresort on Saturday, skitour was planned for Sunday. Our chosen destination was Wilder Kaiser, Ellmauer Tor.   As we drove towards Wochenbrunner Alm, few older avalanches were visible. The parking lot was nearly full after 8:30 am with enough of snow to start skinning up directly from the car. The Ellmauer Tor is said to be one of the most popular ones in the Kaiser region. This proved to be true on this sunny Sunday - we were in “traffic jam” right after the first kilometer. We were allowed to overtake at the first saddle. The snow was hard in the morning and insecure steps would easily lead to undesired elevation loss (aka. very tiring falling over). Numerous skitourers chose to use crampons. As soon as our path cleared up we could keep our usual pace and enjoyed skinning up. We ended up below Hintere Goinger Halt at a spot by rocks where people leave their skis and walk up to the ridge.   Ski descent was great - the part above Ellmauer Tor was powder, later softer snow without crust. The scenery in Kaisergebirge makes the skiing part even more enjoyable.   Litte Tip: Radler in Wochenbrunner Alm is amazing.

        "title": "Mangfall mountains: Trainsjoch and Ascherjoch, Tirol skitour - Mar 19",
        "excerpt":"Parkplatz Mariandlalm was empty at 8 am today, only one car there. The beginning of the tour towards Mariandlalm is possible to skin up however snow was gone on the first 2 kilometers. Temperatures are not dropping these days, expecting to walk there in the few days. We found our way up on the snow side barrier or on small icy patches. We knew from the start we will carry our skis on the way back here. It was quite warm day, 3 degrees in the morning. The snow in the beginning was slushy around Unter Trockenbach Alm.   The snow became more granular above 1000 m.a.s.l. It turned to be more powdery at probably 1300 m.a.s.l. As soon as we arrived to the saddle below Trainsjoch, we noticed the large avalanche slide (see the picture below). We were following the tracks from the man who we met at the parking lot (the only person there besides us). He also was going up to Trainsjoch. We managed to arrive to Trainsjoch after 2 hours. The Trainsjoch descent was fine - fresh snow on the hard surface. We were hesitant to continue to Ascherjoch at first. Should we or not? We decided to continue up there to look for better lines. The descision turned out to be golden.   Ascherjoch was covered by 10 cm of powder. We chose our line through the forest. No one around, just us. We had suddenly happy faces! We put our skis on the shoulders on the first bridge and continued walking mostly to the parking lot. The parking lot was almost full in the early afternoon. Mariandlalm was opened after few days closed due to the avalanches (advertised on their webpage).   Thanks Horst for joining the tour. Ascherjoch was fun today!

        "excerpt":"Sudelfeld ski resort keeps its slopes opened (with restrictions) for evening skitours every Wednesday. There are two routes for skitourers, we chose the route number 1. It starts at Schwebelift station. We started at 19:30 skinning up to our destination - Speck Alm. Small group was ahead of us otherwise we were ascending alone. From time to time skier going down. As we were approaching the lake, head lamps all around us, here comes the crowd! Speck Alm is opened on Wednesday until 21:30, serving hot food only until 21:00.   The conditions were good - clear sky, no winds like we were experiencing days before in Munich (it was windy at the top of the resort). Ski slopes prepared and skiing smooth all the way down. If we get a chance this season, will repeat evening skitour.   Good resources for evening skitours are on nachtskitouren.

        "title": "Garmisch: Osterfelderkopf skitour - Mar 19",
        "excerpt":"Due to weather and no one to join me for skitour today, I chose Garmisch skitour on ski piste, destination Osterfelderkopf. Saturday morning was warm and sunny (compare to rainy yesterday in Munich). When we were in Garmisch 3 weeks ago, there was good amount of snow in the valley. All gone now. We might bike soon, but wait, ski season not over yet.   I started at the Hausberg lift station, already couple of skitourers on the slope ascending. Most of the skitourers I met before the Kreuzneck bahn. Later I was most of the time going alone. The most interesting part of the day was climb from the bottom Hochalmbahn station. I was close to one snow slide which fell close to the skitour track (it was small but gives the signal to choose wisely). Tricky part was where are the chains around the rock corner- the snow was frozen where I had to traverse a bit. Otherwise fine.   Snow was melting, my expectation for skiing down were low. The first ski slope part until flat passages was good, later snow more slushy. The temperature was high at noon - fine for t-shirt in the valley.

        "title": "Mangfall mountains: Brecherspitz-Westgipfel skitour - Mar 19",
        "excerpt":"Our morning skitour started today very early. We were at 6 am at the Kurvenlift parking lot. There were 5 of us, brave early birds. Our destination is Brecherspitz west peak (its smaller brother). It’s accesible by skis.   We can start on skis from the parking lot. We were progressing with good pace. The beginning goes through the forest until we got to a sled road (Rodelbahn). It leads us to the Brecherspitz hang, the wide area that goes all to the top of our destination. There’s lot of powder (10 cm of powder from Monday/Tuesday). We are surprised how fast we got to the top - our estimation was around 1:30 hours. However we reached the summit within one hour. While waiting for our friends to join us, we were looking around as the visibility is very good. Finding our next lines.   We noticed few stones on the way up. Being careful from the start does not help us much, we cross some stones anyway. All of us can’t complain about the descent today. Fresh snow for good lines. We follow almost the same track back to the parking lot. We only deviate from it by entering the forest a bit earlier.   We are back in Munich after 9 am. Very pleased with timing this time and back to our work duties. We all agreed mornings like this should happen more often.

        "title": "Wilder Kaiser: Schönwetterfensterl skitour - Mar 19",
        "excerpt":"Martin has been watching Wilder Kaiser skitour activites since early January this year, when the first report about Kaiserexpress skitour came to his attention. We hiked for 2 days  around Ackerspitze the last year, beatuful sceneries, plenty of scrambling.   We booked Fritz-Pflaum hütte for one night with plan to do at least one skitour in the Griesnar kar (it’s cirque). The toll road is still closed until end of the month, we had to take a shuttle bus to Griesner Alm (they open the gate only for guests in the Alm). We put our skis on at 6pm. There was around one hour of light left and around meter of snow in the valley. As we went up through the forest, the darkness settled down. The snow was heavy, sometimes icy. The moon was in its full phase day before, we were hoping to have good light later in the night. It took us 2:30 hours to get to the hut. When we enquired about availabilitz at the hut, we were told that another group will be there too. Yet, when we arrived the hut was closed. We opened it up, got the fire going and it quickly became cozy.  As the moon got higher, it shined to our valley and we finally could see the mountains around us. The skies were clear and the scenery unforgettable. We basically fell in love with that little hut. Many thanks to those who take care of it!   We woke up at 6 am in the morning to watch the sunrise and left the hut shortly after 8 am. There was only one fellow ski touring enthusiast going our direction before us. Our group divided at the hut, our friends were going later to Regalspitze and we to the Schönwetterfensterl. As soon as we reach the couloir, we put the skis on our back and continued on foot. There were some footsteps already, as this is a popular destination. However, to Danka it seemed only tall people went up, as she sometimes couldn’t reach the steps and had to kick in her own.   We understand the meaning of the name Schönwetterfensterl now. The views are breathtaking up there. We had clear sky, amazing visibility. The descent was pretty exciting, snow was hard but not icy with powder below the couloir. The ski descent is little challenging but good overall. Both of us enjoyed it. We rested at the hut, it was indeed very warm. We also noticed some new snow slabs.   Skiing further down from the hut was harder as sun was hitting most of the valley. Slushy, heavy snow with hard snowballs hidden from older avalanches. We stop at the Greisner alm and used our vouchers from the shuttle for refreshments. We asked about the parking arrangements and why only house guests are allowed to bring their cars up despite of many available spaces. Apparently, the Gemeinde makes the rules. But the lift is great, the employees at the alm are very friendly. There is no need to take the shuttle from the Geisner Alm to the parking lot, it is possible to ski down. Be prepared to skate a lot though. Overall, definitely recommended and we will be coming back.

        "title": "Wilder Kaiser: weekend skitouring - Apr 19",
        "excerpt":"We did skitouring 2 weeks ago in Wilder Kaiser and enjoyed it very much. Thus we decided to come back with friends. We were 7 of us this time. Danka got suddenly a day before departure flu, she had to stay home. The weather forecast was sunny, some clouds later on Sunday. No new snow reported in the area and stable conditions entire week.   We arrived rigth after 9 am to the Griesner Alm parking lot. It was almost full. When we looked up to the forest and the first saddle, we saw crowds going up. Spring season full speed! We were afraid to queue often. It was not the case on the way to the hut, however at least once we got delayed due to skitourer slide. We arrived to the hut by lunchtime, it was closed and empty. We rested and waited for entire group to unite again. The sun was shining, no clouds around and people everywhere. Two skitourers from Tirol joined us at the hut later in the afternoon, we were 9 people total for the weekend.   After the short break, we decided to try Kleines Törl. Kleines Törl is steep shorter gully. The snow was melting because of the sun radiation, our skins started to collect snow. As we were ascending, it became obvious to all of us this is not ideal to complete to the top. There were two options - either go up on foot or just ski down. We decided to turn around at the narrower section. It was a good call, some of our friends have not skied much this season and this was a very good start to introduce them to steeper lines. The descent was good - gully was already in shade, all of us enjoyed it and looked forward for late lunch. After the food we were eager to go skiing around. Griesner kar got empty in the late afternoon, just us here. We decided to watch the sunset. We realized later to actually see the sunset we would need to climb to one of the saddles around. That was not a good idea therefore we stayed in Griesner Kar. It was already hard and icy. We camped close to Mittlekaiser and watched sun going down in the valleys.   Sunday was the day to finish at least one gully. We decided to go to Goinger Törl. As we were approaching the scharte, we noticed how many skitourers are there (question we asked ourselves - where is the lift if there are so many people). It was fine though as it is quite wide in the beginning, people stop by in many places around and scatter themselves around. The sun was shining to the scharte for some time already, snow became slushy. We decided to stop at the narrower section where we noticed first steps in the snow going up. Time to put our skis on our backpaks and just walk up to the saddle. The walk up was easy as steps were already made. Some skitourers were skinning up. It was harder as I looked at them but manageable. However I enjoyed walking up as it was much faster. Not all of us reached the top, some stayed down. We stared to the steep narrower gully and started having doubts about how to ski it safely - all gone after the first turn. It was better than we anticipated. All of us made it safely down without any fall. I was satisfied with the day and it was just the beginning. Some of us decided to ski down bit more (not traverse back to the hut). We got back to the hut by noon. We packed ourselves, cleaned the hut and ski down to the valley. Two of us decide to skin up a bit more to do more lines. The rest of us went down. We all met at Griesner Kar later in the afternoon.   Thanks to everyone who joined us for the weekend!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             griesner kar skitour with friends - Apr 19       Tour info      Drive   1:20 hours   Start   Parking lot at Parkplatz Griesner Alm, 4 euros toll road.

        "title": "Spitzingsee: Österreichische Schinder bike & skitour - Apr 19",
        "excerpt":"I was looking for spring skitour close to Munich. I have seen some people already doing bike &amp; ski in Karwendel, however I could not find anyone to join me on Saturday thus Schnider was the best option - my plan was to get to the end of the valley and explore it. There are two options to get there (not counting from Austria) - Tegernsee or Spitzingsee. As I often go to Spitzingsee, I chose Tegernsee path (I regretted it later, see below why).   I started cycling at 8 am from Suttensee. I could not reach Valepp by car as the road is closed (the first picture) due to avalanche risks. True to be told, there is now lot of snow slid, 3 fallen trees and even some rocks on the road. As I bike up and down, I reach few buildings where the road becomes just snow. I was pushing a bike for about a kilometer when I just gave up. Time to put my skis and start skinning. I later that day regretted a decision not not leaving my bike earlier. Snow was hard in the morning, but did not occur to me it will be slushy in the afternoon. Pushing a bike after skitour is not what I was enjoying much.   I had to carry skis few times as snow is disappearing from the road. Complete snow layer starts right before entering the forest. The first look at Schinderkar from the forest is scary - looks large, Second doubts of the day (the very first is me pushing bike for way too long). As I approach Schinderkar, it becomes “smaller” - changing the perspective. I could see few people skinning up. I overtake some and following two more skitourers. It was going smoothly as it was not icey plus 1 cm of fresh snow so skis were getting to snow easily. As I was doing a kick-turn, my left boot just got out of the ski binding. Not the best place as I was approaching the narrower part of Schinderkar. I decided it is easier and more safe to just walk up (will fix the binding later). The top part is quite steep. Should I carry my skis? At that moment I was looking at 3 skiers going down, they convinced me to ski that part from the top. There is still lot of snow, rocks are almost entirely covered at the top part but not for long, I could see some holes around so might melt this week when the warm temperatures come back.   As I was resting at the top of Schinderkar, one follower who was also going from Tegernsee caught me up. He was going up to Schinder summit (10 minutes walk up). He convinced me to reach the summit. We knew the views were going to be terrible but worth walking up anyway. I returned to my skis, looked down the gully and started skiing down. At this time, only 2 skitoures were going up. It started to be late and warm. Enjoyable skiing down until I reached the forest where it was very much water which slowed me down often. I should have skied it earlier. All was going well until I got back to my bike. Since that moment, my energy came down to zero. I had to push bike through the melted snow. My fault not leaving it earlier. As I found out on the summit, the road from Spitzingsee is clear - not surprising, murphy’s law :)   Very good bike &amp; ski - plenty of snow, early in the morning in good conditions. But please bike from Spiztingsee for the next week or two.

        "title": "Schliersee: Bodenschneidhaus bike - Apr 19",
        "excerpt":"The warm spring weather arrived this week to Munich ! Welcome sunshine, bike time. As snow is still in upper places, we were considering one of lakes nearby. We chose Bodenschneidhaus, with views to Brecherspitze, Rinnerspitz. It was quite warm today, 20 degrees with sun. Our bike tour started in the afternoon to enjoy warm afternoon.   We all met at Camping Lido, there is parking lot for app. 20 cars. Our ascent started after first kilometer. The gravel road gradually goes up. The scenery starts once you pass Kraisenberg Alm. The valley opens and shows snowed peaks. There is still sufficient snow up there, question was: where are our skis? As we bike higher, snow barriers appeared around the path. The road leading to hut is almost clear of snow, only several patches close to the Bodenschneidhaus. The hut is closed at the moment, they will open 1st of May.   We descended via road leading to Neuhaus. There are more snow patches with fallen trees (around 3 trees cross the path). Due to the snow cover, we had to use the gravel road. Schliersee was full of road cyclists and walkers, not like up there where we were almost alone (met few cyclists only).

        "title": "Karwendel: Hochglückscharte skitour - May 19",
        "excerpt":"As result of the temperatures drop earlier this week in Munich, we have snow in Prealps again. Couple of webcams I checked showed new snow - places that were green were white again. I wanted to do bike &amp; ski in Karwendel in April, however we have not managed to do it (mainly before 1st of May as the toll road Hinterriss-Eng opens). I expected plenty people today going to Hochglückscharte but my expectations were exceeded by the reality.   We started quite early to avoid crowds. You only need to carry skis first 50 meters from the parking lot. We start skinning and seeing around 12 people in front of us in distance. There is still lot of snow (compare to the pictures shared from the previous years, this seasons is incredible). Few skitourers went to Hochglück today. We have dozen of people in front of us, another 50 behind us. We are amazed how many skitourers are here today. You need to experience it to believe it and better plan for the next time. The bank holiday in German with weather forecast looked great, fresh snow with good avalanche forecast and the toll road opened the first day - what do you need more?   As soon as we arrive to the top narrow part of Hochglückscharte, there is “skitourers jam”. As I give up with my friend on going futher on skis, we try to walk but the snow is deep - we are up to our waist in the snow, very hard to walk up as it is powdery. We move to the side to empty the col. We rather ski down now, too many people up here and also approaching from below.   The top part is very good - deep powder. It turns to crust on more flat parts of Hochglückkar as it was in shade until late morning. As we traverse Kirchl, the snow became slushy and easier for turns. We saw few smaller avalanches around Eiskarl - snow falling from upper parts. It made quite a noise sometimes, but nothing big, few smaller slides of snow as the falling snow lands.   The parking lot is full of cars on our return. More cars were arriving, even new skitourers - starting around noon. Not ideal conditions today for us, enjoyable skitour after all. We regret not doing it earlier with bikes. Perhaps the next winter seasons.

        "title": "Walchensee: Heimgarten and Herzogstand hike - May 19",
        "excerpt":"The weather got worse after our previous skitour in Karwendel on Wednesday. We decided to hike instead of skitouring. This was my first hike this year (winter not over yet?!).   We started later in the morning from Herzogstandbahn, going to Heimgarten. The path goes up quite rapidly after the first 15 minutes. We started crossing snow patches above 1400 m.a.s.l.. We crossed couple of snow fields but only on our ascent to Heimgarten (one is also on the way down to Walchensee, see the last picture). They are however easy to cross. The ridge trail was snow free.   Note, Heimgarten-hutte is still closed. It should open in the next 2 weeks.   The weather totally surprised us - it changed during the day multiple times. From sun to hails/snowing and rain. We did not expect many hikers - as I was told it is crowded place during the summer season. We met only few people doing the entire round tour connecting both peaks - Heimgarten and Herzogstand. We enjoyed the empty trails, constantly changing weather. The best part, we made it to 2 main peaks of the tour with sun.   On our way down we stopped at Berggasthaus Herzogstand, it is already opened. This was perfect long hiking day, expecting to hike more in the following weeks.

        "title": "Höllen mountains: Feuerkogel weekend hike - May 19",
        "excerpt":"We always admire mountains around Salzburg when driving by. Our friends planned a hike in this area. It is a bit far away from Munich but fine if we go for 2-3 full days. The proposal for the hike was to start from Ebensee and get to Attersee (cross the mountain range around Feuerkogel). Looking at the map, thinking about the valleys - many lakes, ferratas, camps. Looks like a nice place for summer holiday.   Two of us went up to Feuerkogel by a lift, the rest of us (including me) hiked up. We arrived after 10 am to Fuerkogel - tooks us something around 2:15 hours to get up there. Snow started appearing just on the top. Since Feuerkogel, we were walking on the snow almost all day - so much snow in May! We were not certain about snowshoes, all of us had them prepared just in case. After looking from Ebensee to the mountains around, we decided to leave them in the car. The snow cover is hard in the morning, easy to walk on. It got softer in the afternoon with sun radiation, still fine to walk - we were up to our knees only seldomly. The day was very long - it tooks us 10 hours to get from Ebensee to Hochleckenhaus. All was going fine until Rinder hutte. It  was closed. It should be open now as they were preparing it for the summer season.   We followed the path from Rinder hutte. There is winter trail and summer trail as we realized later due to not all maps display these two. The summer trail has some steep pasages we wanted to avoid in this winter conditions. We found ourselves 200 meters below winter trail and had to find our way back to find marking for the winter trail. The winter trail is nicely marked but not all the way. We managed to loose the marking twice. The second time, on the way to Jagerkopf, was harder due to lot of mountain pine. We had to cross them few times to get back to the trail. We arrived before 19 o’clock. The black clouds were chasing us at the end of our day but we managed to get to the hut before it started raining!   Our second day hike started at 9 o’clock. It has rained all night, fog settled down around the hut. The start was without snow but soon enough the snowfields started. We again lost our trail, deviate about 100 meters from the trail within few minutes. My expectation for this second day hike was just decent to the lake. It is not, we ascended almost 400 meters. The hike has some good viewing points and scenery around. We waited at Dachsteinblick, but due to fog we did not manage to see much. It cleared later, we could enjoy the Attersee and its sourroundings. The trail for the final kilometers is on the ridge most of the time, clear of snow. As we had second car at Attersee, we were able to return to Ebensee.   If you are thinking about doing this hike, prepare for winter conditions.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Kampenwand hike - May 19",
        "excerpt":"Almost all our friends are our of town, another day to go hiking alone. I decided to go to Kampenwand. We did one skitour there the last winter (I consider it’s already summer now :-P ). Due to strong winds and fog we did not reach the top and returned early. Today was the day to reach the summit by foot!   I parked the car at 9 am, parking lot almost empty. Not that many people going up, met only few. THe initial kilometers are on the asphalt road, later gravel road. I was glad once I turned to the forest where hiking trail started. I was surprised to see bikers with hard tails going down - it was all wet because it rained. Trail was quite rocky (I would rate it S1, sometimes S2). As I approached Steinlingalm, people started appearing much more. Plenty of bikers and hikers going up to the hut.   Few of us continued to Kampenwand. There is still big snow field right below Kampenwand. As temperatures rises this week, it was soft - easy to walk. There are two more smaller snow patches in the scrambling area, I walked over them. Otherwise the entire trail is snow free. Once I got up, I realized what we missed when we were not able to complete our skitour. The views towards Chiemsee are nice.   I did not want to go the same way so chosen to follow the road to Kampenwandbahn. As I walked I found one turn to the forest, I was fed up with asphalt again. To my surprise, I ended up walking on very good looking singletrack (S1 most of the time). We will return with bikes the next time.

        "title": "Kochel am See: Sonnenspitz - Jochberg - Rabenkopf hike - Jun 19",
        "excerpt":"I have alredy been to area near to Kochel am See twice but never started our hike directly from Kochel am See. Once we ended our bike weekend here, the second time was Herzogstand hike  3 weeks ago. We wanted to visit again this area. I found few hikes to Sonnenspitz or Jochberg or Rabenkopf - usually started from different places. This gave me an idea to connect all of them together.   We started from Kochel am See. Our first summit was Sonnenspitz. There are good singletracks around here. The ascent becomes steep later, it is narrow and curvy. The Sonnespitz views are incredible, however not 360 panorama as Jochberg or Rabenkopf provide - much nicer panorama views. We continued from Sonnenspitz to Jochberg. You loose some meters, the trail goes down first and then up again. Jochberg provides views all around with even two tables identifying most of the peaks you can see. Karwendel mountain range is still snow covered. Skitour anyone now?   The trail goes down from Jochberg and continues up and down until you reach meadows below Rabenkopf. This is the 3rd ascent of the day, going again above 1500 m.a.s.l.. Rabenkopf is popular (same goes to Jochberg), expect more people here (we haven’t met many hikers/bikers on the way from Jochberg to Rabenkopf). The descent from Schwarzeck is steep, gravel and very curvy - it might be better to ascent than descent. You loose most of the meters in very short time. From Orteler alm it is mostly gravel road. I recommend on the way back to turn to Lainbachfall watterfalls. That is what we did, small ascent leads to nice waterfalls. We were there alone to our surprise.   There are 3 alms along the trail where you can have refreshments (no overnight stays though!). I have discovered plenty of singletracks in the area, we will get back here on bikes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               4 summits hike from Kochel am See  - Jun 19       Tour info      Drive   1 hour   Start   Parking lot at “Parkplatz at Kochelsee”, free during the day   Duration   9 hours   Activity view   Sonnenspitz part     The rest of the hike     I published this hike also on alpenvereinaktiv  ","categories": ["hike"],

        "excerpt":"My yesterday after work mountain-biking round started in Kreuth. We haven’t visited this area yet. This was my first discovery ride to look around what has been waiting for us.   I started in Kreuth, pedaling along the river. Good warm up of the tour - it goes up and down for 6 kilometers. Once you cross the river and road, the ascent gravel road starts. There are many more parking spots because of so many hiking trails. The ascent goes up smoothly, just one or two short steeper sections.   The road opens when you approach Schwarzentenn-Alm. Buchstein and other peaks around are visible. More ascent meters awaits until the Weidberg-Alm. Note, the last few hundreds meters are forbidden for bikes. I walked here. The way down goes through various forest paths, I would rate it S1 (S2 in some sections, very few). There are sections with fallen trees crossing trails where you have to carry your bike over, quite visible ahead.   On the way back the road was closed to Tegernsee, I had to go all around via Lenggries - what a surprise (this was not the only detour unfortunately).

        "title": "Tegernsee: Rossstein hike - Jun 19",
        "excerpt":"I went for a bike ride around Hischberg this week. While I was ascending,  I noticed hut between two rocky summits - this was the Tegernseer hut. Our friends agreed to our proposal for the hike to Rossstein, the summit next to the hut.   The ascent goes up very quickly through the forest. The trail becomes less steep at Sonnberg Alm Hochleger. This is the place where you can see Rossstein and Buchstein summits. There were few climbers visible below the rocks preparing for their climbs. The next part of the trail is the most interesting - marked as “klettersteig”. I was scared at first when reading some blogs without much details. It is only couple of fixed ropes, regular scrambling. It is narror sometimes. Thus if people are going down this way, you might need to wait a bit. In our case, we had to wait for a big group to descent. The hut is already opened. The descent via Altweibersteig is closed at the moment - the note is placed at the parking lot and also at the hut.   We decided to descend via alternative trail that goes from Rossstein. This was another scrambling part. We reached the gravel road leading to Rosssteinalm where we met couple of bikers. There is also a trail going through the forest. The initial parts are steep, narrow, not much suitable for bikes. The second part of the forest trail becomes much more suitable for mtb. The trail from Röhrlmoosalm back to the parking lot goes along the beautiful creek. It leads back to Glasshuette road, 1 kilometer from the parking lot.

        "title": "Tegernsee: Around Rossstein mtb - Jun 19",
        "excerpt":"We found few singletracks when we hiked to Rossstein 2 weeks ago. The most appealing is the Röhrlmoos Alm trail (it can be found also on trailforks) and one that leads to it (don’t go all the way down via gravel road).   The bike day starts at Parkplatz Klamm (3 euros for a day). The ascent is smooth, on the gravel road and goes all the way to below Sonnberg Alm. There is the new road the last 300 meters. Once it ends, the trail goes up to the Alm, very rocky thus we were carrying our bikes. The downhill starts at the intersection below Rossstein. Here you can descent and ascent a bit. Note, descent from the saddle below Rossstein via singletrack - push your bike here. There is plenty of wood water drainage. They are quite sticky out of the trail. We realized later once we met someone who we had an argument with (the beginning was OK but later probably newer drainage are placed argumently too high). We pushed the bikes until Roßsteinalm. Lesson learned and will stay ouf ot them.   We took few turns on the gravel road until the singletrack down to Röhrlmoos Alm. There is at least one more turn earlier, very steep and curvy (I would rate it S3 at least). The later one is S2.   Take a left turn after Röhrlmoos Alm. This singletrack follows Schliffbach all the way down to the main road. It has a good flow, few rocky sections and roots, rated as S2. After this singletrack, there’s gravel road along the river Wiessach back to the parking lot.

        "title": "Tegernsee: Blauberg hike - Jun 19",
        "excerpt":"I am visiting 4th in the row the same destination - right below Tegernsee. You know that feeling when you hike and find singletracks? Then you ride your bike there and find mountain range for hike? The latter was the case for us as we discovered Blauberg crest hike on Friday. The hike is not that long, 20 kilometers total but due to the rocky sections on the way up and also down, it takes a bit longer.   The beginning of the trail starts smoothly on a gravel road. There is Siebenhütten after first 20 miuntes walking. You can stop by here, or as we did on the way back. It is recommended to ascent towards Predigtstuhl - steep rocky section with many fixed ropes. This is the direction we followed. Once you reach Predigtstuhl summit, you are on the crest leading to Haslerspitz (still way to go and more ascent meters to gain as there is still around 300 altitude meters difference). The views are great. You can see Tegernsee, Spitzingsee mountains (Rotwand, also Rotwandhaus), Schneider summit, Rofan mountains plus others as well. It is worth doing it in conditions favoring the good visibility. The hike goes up almost all the way to the last summit, Haslerspitz. The descent from Haslerspitz might be challenging for some people. I suspect trail changed after winter, expect some loose ground. No wonder there is a warning on the top.   Our conditions varied, there was fog at times or clouds but we managed to get good visibility. To our surprise, we only met half of dozen hikers, mostly around Haslerspitz. The rest of the hike was just us. Perhaps due to weather forecast - it was expected to have storms with heavy ranes later in the afternoon. The weather was however cloudy almost no rain until 5 pm.   It is worth doing this crest trail, plan entire day. There are 2 snow patches that has to be crossed before you touch the rocky trail up to Predigtstuhl. They look like a bridge and fine to be crossed as the snow is greatly compact. Check pictures below for details.

        "title": "Mangfall mountains: Wendelstein and Lacherspitze evening hike - Jun 19",
        "excerpt":"Beautiful afterwork hike in Bayrischzell, Wendelstein and Lacherspitz. It was supposed to be the hottest day of the year in Munich - forecast 35 degrees. Despite these very hot days in the recent weeks, there are still patches of snow in Prealps.   Our evening hike was a private tour - no people. It might be because of the temperature or it was evening, no hikers around. Who would expect empty Wendelstein summit? Anyway, our goal for the day was Lacherspitz. Friends saw Wendelstein during ascending to Lacherspitz and quickly convinced me to do detour. The highlight of the hike was 2 Chamois on top of the rock observing us (see the picture gallery below) near Lacherspitz. Afterwards we watch the sunset, the sun hide behind Wendelstein and we continued to our starting point. This was relaxing evening after the workday.

        "title": "Karwendel: Schöttelkarspitze & Soiernsee round hike - Jun 19",
        "excerpt":"I discovered Soiernsee this week while browsing Instagram and I immediately checked if we can sleep over in the hut (Soiernhaus). There were 5 places left on Friday (nothing for Saturday) Let’s do it. I was surprised to see in hut conditions: arrival prior 17, the reservation will be freed after 19. This was not ideal for our plan to hike via few peaks on Friday ater work. I contacted the hut via various sources (email, phone, sms), no reponse so we prepared ourselves for everything.   The ascent is via Schöttelkarspitze was much more appealing to us than via Fischbach. The beginning of the trail starts to follow Hüttlebach stream. It leads us to Hüttlebachklamm, nice waterfalls with ladders going up. Similar to a trail we have back home called “Janosikove diery”. This one is short though. Few ladders and we are in the forest where the trail goes most of the way up to Seinskopf. The first panorama place is here - views of Schöttelkarspitze, Wachensee, Mittenwald or Garmisch open at Seinskopf, incredible surroundings.   We continued via traverse trail to the saddle Feldernkreuz. Sun was going down while we are still far away from the hut (not yet even seen it). We have not stopped much since Seinskopf to be as fast as we can to find somewhere to rest. We reached Schöttelkarspitze late in the evening, just at the moment to watch sun going down, hide itself behind mountains. The sky was clear, the evening was warm but only until the sun was gone. I highly recommend this summit for sunrise/sunset! You can view mountain ranges around: Karwendel, Wachensee, Zugspitze and others.   We descended to Soiernhaus, to have breakfast. After the break, we walked around Soiernsee. Our decision where to continue was made. To descent via regular trail back to Krün. Soiernspitze has to wait. Note, Soiernscharte nord part is covered by patches of snow (visible in the gallery). We saw few people going up in the morning. On our way back we met lot of bikers. Many of them leave bikes at the private hut lift station to be able to walk up to the lakes.   Another time Soiernspitze, see you later.

        "title": "Walchensee: Sachenbach mtb - July 19",
        "excerpt":"We returned on our bikes to a place I hiked few weeks back (Sonnenspitz blog post). We discovered few singletracks in the area but one I did not back then was Sachenbach trail. As it is rated S3, I was skeptical about going down the trail (some pics show rocky sections I am not yet fond of - just more practice :-) ). You can go around via gravel road and later hiking path (S0-S1). Of course that was not our case.   Our starting point was Kochel am See, early in the morning to avoid the hot sunny afternoon. The ascent is gravel road all the way to Sachenbach trail. It’s less than 2 hours to the trail - there are multiple ways to reach it we just followed signs and the road. It goes a bit around.   We decided not to climb any higher to the hut below Jochberg but rather to enjoy the lake. The beginning of the trail is fine. After few dozen of meters the rocks started to be more apparent and drops bigger. Once this steeper rocky section ended, we followed the gravel road down and took one more turn to the forest, S1 singletrack all the way down to the lake. Half of the biking done day so far, the next destination is Pionierweg. As we started climbing towards it, my freehub started being opened (pulls are not engaging properly) and I was not able to pedal anymore. I was lucky as the way back to our starting point was all the way down - almost pedal free. I wanted to avoid a road, found forest path next to the road, rated as S0-S1. It leads to the lake. I waited for my friends at the lake. They did not enjoy Pionierweg- I was told it is more hiking path that biking one.   Time to replace the rear freehub to resolve the issue. New freehub part should come tomorrow. Hopefully this will be over.   By the way, I will be away for a month, traveling to Fann mountains, blog again in August!

I fixed my freewheel yesterday (failed to do before my departure). Today was the test day. Danka’s friend joined me for mtb ride. I had Jenbachtal bookmarked for a year, about the time to bike this one. As I was looking at the map in this area, there are many bike trails around that are waiting to be explored.   We arrived to the Deisenried parking lot in the morning and it was already quite full. Most of the people went up to Tregleralm. The ascent is after few kilometers and changes to descent quite often (the trail goes up and down most of the time - my feeling). We haven’t met many people in the beginning. It became more crowded later when we get to Jenbachsteig river. Many cars in the parking lot there.   We biked mostly on gravel roads (S0-S1 in some spots), otherwise it is asphalt. There are possibilities to find some singletracks on the way down (I found few, S1) although today was the day for easier ride to get back on bike after a break.

        "title": "Kitzbühel: Großer Rettenstein  - Aug 19",
        "excerpt":"We biked twice in Kitzbühel the last year and we had great time there on bike trails. Including, the longest singletrack in Tirol - Fleckalm trail. As we did not feel for cycling on Saturday, we decided to go for a hike to Großer Rettenstein. I remember a great picture taken by Danka while we were on bikes the last year, Großer Rettenstein was in the background.   We used the toll road to get to Hintenbachalm. There is a parking lot and a restaurant nearby (Kasplatzl). Otherwise you can park before the toll road and hike from there. I believe better option would be to use bikes and go even higher than we started (you can climb on bike a bit as there are couple of roads leading up there. It would shorten the total hike distance quite a bit.   We immediately turn to the forest from the parking lot to start ascending fast. We gained over 400 meters within the first half hour. It flattens a bit once you cross the Schöntalbach. The valley opens and Großer Rettenstein summit is visible on the left. As soon as you approach the peak, the trail goes steeply up. It is gravel, soil and rocks. Steps need to be sometimes longer, made us slow down a bit. Some scrambling at the end to reach the summit, and we made it there a bit after 2 hours. Wilder Kaiser, Hohe Tauern visible from the summit. We also were looking around for possibilities to bike and of course, finding the lines for skitouring :-)   The descent was much faster than we expected as we were worried for the scrambling part to be slow. We only met few people on our way back, the trails just for us to our suprise almost entire time.

        "title": "Saalbach mtb weekend - August 19",
        "excerpt":"We have not been much biking this year, not to mention almost barely visited Alps on wheels. It was about the time to meet few friends and hit some trails. We were 8 of us for 3 days in Saalbach, Austria. 400 km of trails was waiting for us. Many of accommodations provide “Joker card” - most importantly, the lifts. Our plan was to bike as much as we can. Truth be told, as much as your hands can handle.   We arrived on Thursday to Saalbach. As I had to work on Friday, I only joined my friends for a short morning ride. Thus I did Panorama trail twice. Friends stayed and enjoyed trails the entire day. Most of the time they spent in Panorama trail but they tried also x-line. They however complained it was steep with bigger drops so had to either aviod big drops or brake too much. Thus we were planning to stay on blue or red trails for the rest of the weekend. One of the reason as well was that the trails are damaged in some places due to the end of the season approaching. We had our hands pumped often!   We met a local friend on Saturday morning, did Hacklberg trail twice for the start. Quiet long singletrack providing variety conditions. By the time of our second time (around noon), there were lot of people on the trail. As we were 9 of us, we sometimes ended up up to 20 people waiting at some wider spots. The number of bikers as we were told is because the Westgipfelbahn is opened this season (they are renovating the lift opposite to it on the other side), the trail is easily accessible to everyone. You normally have to bike from the other side around 200m ascent meters. After Hacklberg trail, we continued to Blue line and Pro line trails. The last hour was dedicated to Panorama trail. We liked that one the most - we repeated the first part so many times and could not get enough.   Stay strong!

        "title": "Schliersee: Gindelalm mtb - Sept 19",
        "excerpt":"There is going to be change in the weather in the following days. I noticed in the forecast for Tirol light snowing predicted, should I be worried winter is coming so early? Anyway, weather is nice these days thus we planned a bike ride after work. I have not yet ridden my “training” round to Gindelalm so I proposed that one to my friends, no objections.   When we arrived to the parking lot, there were cars with bike racks so we knew there will be plenty bikes up there. The start is not that simple from this parking lot as you have to make few turns through the village to get to the road going up. It’s easy for me now that I know the road. Once you arrive to the road leading up, it starts ascending slowly. There are few spots that are flat otherwise almost the entire way is going up. The last few hundreds meters to Gindelalm are flat. All three Alms up there were opend today after 18 when we arrived. There were lot of bikers and hikers as well. Not only us wanted to enjoy one of the last summer days (hope not, we want more).   Once you take a turn from Gindelalm, you cycle for about 10 minutes through the forest going up and down until you reach the singletrack going all way down. It’s smooth S1 trail with few zick-zack. This is the favorite part. Be aware there are hikers who might be suprised to see you (speaking from experience).

        "title": "Fann mountains - Kulikalon lakes, part 1 - Jul 19",
        "excerpt":"This is going to be slightly longer blog post than our weekend trip reports. We were 5 of us (myself, Stefan, Ivana, Tomas and Martin) going to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan this summer for 4 weeks. Our proposal was to spend 3 weeks hiking and one week sighseeing plus traveling. We split the trip into 4 parts.   Our entire hike is planned here on alpenvereinaktiv.   Using slazav map (very good map for fann mountains):             Our fann mountains hike - Slazam map   We used this map often to navigate.   The planned hike in numbers:      18 days in mountains   160 km   over 12 km ascent meters   Hike split into 4 parts:      Kulikalon lakes   Chimtarga pass (Zamok and Energia summits including)   Iskanderkul via Doinoi pass   Hissar range (White Pyramid summit)   This is just part 1 of our hike, including visiting two cities - Samarkand and Buchara.   Samarkand &amp; Buchara   12.7 - The beginning of our trip start in Samarkand. There’s small airport where only few flights land per week. Most of them are from Moscov, one we took as well. We arrived very early, at 5 am to Samarkand. Unfortunately, my backpack did not arrive with us so I had to deal with the crew of Aeroflot there. We were able to find someone to communicate in English however they were quite convinced my backpack would not be in the flight right after ours, few hours later as it was not Aeroflot. As we were exhausted and convinced my backpack will arrive on Sunday to Buchara - that was our agreement with the crew there. As soon as we left the terminal building one taxi driver approached us. We experienced the first what we later named “vulture”. His first proposal was way out of the price we were eager to pay. After our first refusal, he left and on the way to find other taxis, we agreed on the price. As our initial plan was to go directly to Tajikistan, we had to find a hotel and stay in Samarkand for a day. Hiking postponed until my backpack arrives.   Samarkand has lot of history. I was not aware of it much so discovering these new places with so much around them was astonishing. The first place we visited was Siyob bazaar. Tasty dried fruits, fresh products and our favorite restaurant in the centre of it. We had to return here on our way back from mountains to shop a bit. After two days of sightseeing, we traveled to Buchara. To catch a cab, you have to go north to the bus terminal. History repeates itself, 10 taxi drivers around us convincing us we should go with them. We agreed with one, 5 of us in one regular sedan car. He argued a bit with others for another 5 minutes while we waited in the car.   13.7 - We spent one day in Buchara, walking around the city. We caught a bus on our way back. We wanted initially to go by taxi again but people were pointing us to a bus. New comfortable bus (like we see here in Europe for long distance traveling), suprising. We experienced one problem when they allocate seat by just writing a seat on your receipt. After a while people came to us claiming that we are at their seats. We had to move after all but all good.   14.7 - As soon as we get to Buchara, me and Stefan went to the airport to collect my backpack. What we found out, it was there since Friday morning (the next flight after ours). I have it finally ! Time to go to Tajikistan. Our next town was Panjakent. We again had to take taxi to the bus station where we took a cab to the border crossing. It opened in the recent years. We had no issue to go through. Just received questions about what are our plans there and if we are alpinists. Plenty of taxis right behind the bars, waiting for us. We arrived to Panjakent in the evening, booked a hostel. There are always some hikers or travelers. We met lot of interesting people with various stories.   We arranged a drive the next morning to Vertical Alaudin. The drive was quite good. The half of the trip is on the new road they built, then at Sarvoda you turn to the gravel road that leads to Vertical Alaudin. 4 wheels drive recommended. It was bumpy and steep. We arrived to Vertical Alaudin in the early afternoon. We looked arond and saw still plenty snow in the peaks around. We talked to people, there were some russian expeditions, mostly climbers and some smaller groups like us. We prepared our things for the first trip - Kulikalon lakes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Samarkand and Buchara sightseeing - Jul 19       Kulikalon lakes hike   16.7 - We started early in the morning to avoid afternoon sun. It was very warm during the day as soon as sun came out. Our first saddle was at 3800 m.a.s.l. We started feeling the altitude while ascending, almost all of us. Nothing serious just realizing we are going higher thus we should breathe more. As we arrived to the saddle we had plenty of time. Therefore we decided to walk on the ridge to reach the peaks nearby. We left backpacks and walked for a half hour to be on top of to us unknown peak. We saw first donkeys carrying things, coming from Kulikalon lakes. Apart from these local people, we haven’t met almost anyone on the way to the lakes. 2 more russian hikers only. Once we reached the lakes, we went for a swim. The lake was cold - very much appreciated after the hike with sun above us. There is “chcaychana” at the lake where they cook and also sell some beverages. We had to wait at least one hour, good we talked to them before our swim. We had late lunch there and rested in the shade. We decided to move higher to lake Duschaka which is at 3000 m.a.s.l. - less people and higher. We found nice spot under the tree for almost all of us. There were no people around, neither ranger. He came the next day and we paid for these 2 nights (2 dollars per night per person). As this lake is higher and surrounded by mountains, the sun goes down earlier. This means quite cold nights. The glacier is not that far from there.   17.7 - The next day was our first acclimatizaiton summit -Gouhona, 3600 m.a.sl. . We hiked down to the Kulikalon lakes, went around them and started ascending. There was no trail going to the peak in the beginning. We later found one but often just disappeared. We found our own way. The last part to the summit is easy scrambling. We had a quick lunch at the top and returned via the opposite site of the lakes. There are many streams so we had to cross them multiple times. The other side of the lakes was much easier to walk.   18.7 - We left Dushokha lake early at 6 am to go to Alaudin pass. Our destination for today was Alaudin lakes where we wanted to stay one night. There is also “cajchana”, I believe two but we went to only one. We had to return to the Vertical Alaudin to leave some things there and hike back in the evening. The next destination is Mutnyi lakes and its surroundings. I will write the part 2 of our hike in the next blog spot, stay tuned!

        "title": "Fann mountains - Mutnoe lake (Zamok, Energia), part 2 - Jul 19",
        "excerpt":"Before we leave Alaudin lakes to explore Mutnoe lake, I should mention how we packed as I received often a question how heavy were our backpacks, what was inside, etc. This article will describe the longest hike we did without any civilization (no tea room or any opportunity to buy supplies). This part was supposed to take 15 days. The next stop where we could buy food or beverage would be in Iskanderkul. You would normally go via Kaznok pass to get to Iskanderkul from Alaudin lakes. As I recall it is 2-3 days hike but we wanted to visit Big Allo lake and prolong the hike via some saddles. Besides food, we had 2 tents with us. 4 of us were sharing one (Stefan most of the time bivac outside) and Ivana one for herself. 2 ropes (20 and 30 meters in length), full glacier equipment (the heaviest part of our backpacks). Each one of us had one gas canister.   Our food supplies were mostly dried food and couscous, oats. I bought a drier before the trip. It ran constantly for 3 weeks to dry everything I could. We had over 1 kg of beef jerky thanks to that! All of us packed 15 days food with us, we often cooked together one meal (put ingredients together what all had). We were surprised what we could come up with and how tasty it was (or we were that hungry!).   Regarding water, there was lot of snow from winter when we were there. Thus plenty of streams could be found that contain clean water in the morning (later the water became dirty and we had to clean filter more often). We always filter no matter how clean water looked like, to avoid stomach issues. We used Sawyer filters and squeeze container. Convinient and worked nicely for our entire hike.   Now back to our hike, part 2:   19.7 - Once we get back to Alaudin Vertical camp, we unpacked everything (we left few bags there with our stuff, not needed for our first part) and start packing again. This time we knew we need to be careful what we take with us - weight consideration and also to have enough food for 15 days. Our backpacks were around 22 kg when we arrived to Samarkand but still we wanted to get rid of few things. We left 2 duffel bags that will be transferred to Iskanderkul for 100 dollars. After careful consideration, we were ready to go back to Alaudin lake and continue to Mutnoe lake the next day. The funny thing is our backpacks were always full no matter how much we ate. It became lighter but still stuffed to the top.   After walking few hunders meters we realized our backpacks are heavy and what awaits will be challenging - to go up to 4700m with this weight. First stop was Mutnoe lake camp spot, it was only around 3500 m.a.s.l. It is 4 hours hike from Alaudin lakes. We come here in early afternoon and found a spot on the left side of the lake - to get there you need to jump dozen of big rocks. Something I was not fond of with heavy backpack but I got used to after a while. There was a stream of water from melting snow. This is where we got our water from. We were the only tent on this side of the lake. We set up our camp and prepared for the next day - the first above 4000 meters peak - Granuleta. There was still plenty of snow at 3500 m.a.s.l, we knew we will need crampons and ice axes for Granuleta.   20.7 - Early start in the morning means snow is hard and streams are frozen. I almost crashed my knee while crossing one stream and put my foot on slippery rock. Lesson learned, need to be more careful in the morning. The snow was slowly melting by sun radiation so once we got below Granuleta, it was easy to walk on. We reached Granuleta, 4172 m.a.s.l without complications (the top part was a rock ridge) but otherwise everything was covered by snow. Guys wanted to take a different path so we split. They continued to unknown to us ridge to explore. Me and Ivana returned the same way. The snow became mashy and I slid at least twice (I made not-planned self arrest). It took us around 5 hours to go up and back from to Granuleta. We met Belgian couple who were not equipped for the current conditions (an ice axe or crampons). Chimtarga pass was covered with snow almost all way up. They were waiting for some people to make a path and more favourable conditions. Group of around 8 people went up the next day and this couple followed the next day. As we did not meet them agin, we believe they successfully hike down to the village as they planned to.   21.7 - We did glacier training to revise what we knew. The plan for the afternoon was to go up to Zamok glacier. Only 4 of us went up to Zamok glacier. Ivana stayed at Mutnoe lakes and made her own plan for the next 2 days. We arrived below Zamok before sunset. There was water stream near the camping place where we got water from. We observed the glacier, finding a way for tomorrow. The next morning my friends started after 7 am. I decided to rest so stayed at the camp site resting. It took them a half day at least, I noticed them on the glacier in the early afternoon. I was worried for a while why it took them that long (it could be me waiting for so long there). We had a quick lunch and returned back to Mutnoe lake. The same spot as previously because we left few things hidden in the rocks. We repacked again and prepared for the next day - going up to Chimtarga pass. The highest point with all our stuff.   23.7 - We noticed few other people going up to Chimtarga pass in the morning, they were ahead of us. We overtook them once they stopped for a rest. We found out they are from Czech republic and going as well up to Energia. We continued all the way up to the Chimtarga pass with short break to meet Ivana again after 2 days. She camped at 4500 m.a.s.l but we wanted to sleep over in the saddle. There were streams from melting snow at 4500 m.a.s.l.  Our last chance to get water, we refilled all our bottles/camelbaks as we were not certain if we can find something up in the saddle. There was no one in the saddle just us. The sunset was spectacular as well as the views!   24.7 - our today mission - Energia summit. 2 Russian hikers started earlier than us and were already climbing up while we were preparing. It was convinient to camp in the saddle as we could sleep longer and still be climbing quite early in the morning. As we started ascending, snow turned to ice soon enough. We started using ropes. We all worked hard to have fixed rope for all us for safety reasons. The surface was very good for ice screws, we had problems only rarely to put them in. However as we were 4 of us (Stefan stayed down to rest), it took us longer than we expected (the beginning was slow to distribute the work and find good balance between us). There were lot of ropes for abseil on the rocks, like every 30 meters one abseil point created. We believe somebody put them up there just this season as we did not recall any mention from the previous years in the reports we found. After 6 hours, we were back at our tent. Without much hesitation, we agreed to go down as soon as we could to go lower. We had few hours of light, sufficient time to go lower and found good camping spot. Some of us were convinced we could go down all the way to Big Allo. As Stefan started earlier, we met him later in the evening. He already was resting and wanted to stay overnight probably around 2 hours from Big Allo. We decided to stay with him and just bivouac outside. We were fed up with constat opening and packing the tent. We here found again trash dump - lot of cans left behind. There were often in Fann mountains. We do not understand these people how they can leave behind such trash. We could see there newer canister, plastic bottles or even goulash pot - who would carry this and leave it ?   25.7 - We moved to Big Allo where we stayed for almost 1.5 days. We finally had a rest day - swimming, sleeping and eating all day.   The next part will be the hike from Big Allo to Iskanderkul.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Kampenwand Reitweg trail mtb - Sept 19",
        "excerpt":"After work ride with Peter in Kampenwand area in the middle of the week. We had sunny weather in Munich therefore we could not resist to cycle after work. I hiked few months ago up to Kampenwand and I discovered few trails on the way back. One of them was Reitweg, shown as blue trail on Trailforks. The trail consists of two parts.   Our starting point was Chiemgau Hochseilgarten. There is natural swimming pool next to it. The parking is free and almost empty when we arrived in the late afternoon. We somehow could not find the beginning of our trail so we crossed few meadows to find the ski bench and the forest road we should have taken. This forest road led us to Mais-Alm. The way up was fine, we also lost few dozen of ascent meters in the middle where we were wondering where to continue. As there was a trail going up, we decided to diverge from the proposed track and find our own way. This diversion allowed us to follow hiking trail, sometimes steep and narrow so we ended up pushing our bikes. Mais-Alm was still opened as it was sunny evening, plenty people sitting outside enjoying the week day evening.   Few more turns up from Mais-Alm and the gravel road started going down. Note, you find Reitweg on the right side while descending first hundreds meters. Do not be scared of big rocks at the beginning, the trail is rated as S1. You can climb it in the opposite direction without problems. There are at least 2 trees fallen, the trail is not completely clear but nothing major. We did not continue to the lower part as there is a sign “no biking allowed”, we were not certain why so we followed the gravel road down to the village and back to our car. It would be almost 3 km of trail with it, anyway good bike ride after work.

        "title": "Tegernsee: Baumgartenschneid trail mtb - Sept 19",
        "excerpt":"Days are becoming shorter, with less opportunities for post-work rides like this one :/. Soon, we will need to do early morning trips rather than evening ones.   We chose Baumgartenschneid for mountain bike evening. It is 5 kilometers technical trail (total trip is around 13 kilometers). We started at Tegernsee train station. The first part is familiar to us, we cycled it with my sister a year ago - Prinzenweg bike trail connecting Tegernsee and Schliersee. It has a smooth start, good warm-up. We left Prinzenweg below Sagfleckl, there is S1 trail going up through the forest - this was the nicest part of the ascending. The trail started to be difficult for riding our bikes after Sagfleckl. We put our bikes on our shoulders and continued to Baumgartenschneid.   There is a trail going below Baumgartenschneid, therefore we left our bikes there in the meadows below Baumgartenschneid and went up by foot. No one was on the summit, just us. We only met one trail runner descending otherwise no one was around. The trail starts from the summit, rated as S2 most of the time. There are harder passages with steep turns or large drops on very narrow trail (we would rate it S3). The sun was going down quickly during our descend and we had to use headlamps in the last hundreds meters (it is much darker in the forest). We were surpised with a beautiful night view of Tegernsee and stopped and enjoyed the view with the silence around us.   Challenging trail, happy to repeat with less carrying the next time!

        "title": "Martinske hole Slovakia mtb - Sept 19",
        "excerpt":"We went back home to Slovakia for couple of days. We brought our bikes with us, since there are some very nice trials and tracks in Velka Fatra. Couple of friends and us chose a crest trail starting at Martinske Hole. Some parts of this track have been used for SPEN II (Slovakian Enduro National Cup) this summer, therefore the trials have been cleaned and well prepared.   Martinske Hole is a ski resort and is easily accessible by car. The access road is quite narrow and you should be aware of the many holes. There is a free parking at the end of the road, which is where we left the car. From the parking lot, we biked up to the broadcasting tower and biked along the crest towards Mincol (1363 m.a.s.l). The views along the crest and from Mincol are amazing. The trial is fine to bike on. We encountered couple of hikers on the way. We took a trial (we would rate it as S1) down to the ski resort Holy Diel. Majority of the trial is gravel or mud trials with roots.   From Holy Diel we biked upwards to a very popular trial called Anakonda (rated S1, some parts S2). As a side-note, its said that this trial used to be used by hunters back in the day. Wood logging changed the trail a bit. Pretty sad, the hunting as well as the logging… Anyway, the Anaconda trial is quite fun. It was well prepared due to SPEN II. From there we took the gravel road to the closest pub for refreshments.   Very much recommended for the views. Downhill trials are fun!

        "title": "Jesenik: Rychlebske and Lipovske trails, Czech republic mtb - Sept 19",
        "excerpt":"We had wonderful 3-days weekend in Jesenik at the end of September. We wanted to come to Jesenik for some time as we hear so much about it. We arrived to Jesenik on Thursday evening. Firstly we planned a hike due to rainy foggy day. It was short family hike to Paprsek.   The weather got better on Saturday. Lukas led us to Zlaty Chlum. We started from Jesenik, the trail goes via various forest roads that lead. Logging is ongoing in the forests around Jesenik. We had to carry bikes few times. As a result of heavy machinery and recent rains, the forest roads were muddy. Zlaty Chlum was busy, dozen of people were enjoying local beer with sausages cooked on the fire there. The tower is more than 100 years and accessible to public - entrace as I recall was 20 CZK. Our group split here for the descent, as we wanted to follow some local trails down. Danka, me and Lukas turned from the regular hiking path to more narrow trails - rated S1 (only few steeper sections could be S2). We turned to another trail called “Krizova cesta” - rated S1. I got flat tire right before this trail unfortunately. I started to feel my rear tire drifting from side to side. I realized it is loosing air right under my feet. I stopped and fixed it partly only. I followed others but had to push my bike the last 20 minutes. I decided to fix it properly once we get back home.   Danka decided to stay home as she did not feel the best in the recent days. Me and Lukas went for afternoon rides in Lipovske stezky. These trails were without much traffic, we only met 4 more bikers. The trails are shorter, curvy with couple of bumps (what we biked there was S0 - S1 trails). We did couple of them for a hour or so to be back home before the sunset.   Sunday was reserved for Rychlebske stezky - trails we heard so much. We had only morning reserved for biking as we still had to travel back to Munich later that day. We managed to cycle trails Naucna stezka and Velryba. Me and Danka quickly realized we should have done something easier at first - this was our first time on the type of trails like Velryba (we did not want to try Wales as the next one but rather decided to continue to Superflow). We stopped soon after the beginning to cool down and had to find a good pace for descending. Velryba trail was easier after we got “the feeling”.   The next one and our last one to get down to valley - Superflow trail. As there has been logging in the forests, not all sections were ride-able - there was a short detour. The loggers were there even on Sunday. This was the fun of the day for us! Pity we did not manage more, left plenty of trails for our next visit.

        "title": "Nepal Day 1: Kathmandu to Chame - Oct 19",
        "excerpt":"Travelling usually means getting on a train, bus or an occasional plane. Well, not this time. The plane was just the beginning to get to Kathmandu. Thats where it all started. Driving in Kathmandu calls for commando-like survival skills to manoeuvre among legions of motorcycle drivers, who squirm left and right and everywhere to beat the stalled traffic. Local drivers also use the horn as signal of right-of-way. There are no drive-yourself rental cars available in Nepal, but you can easily hire a car or jeep with a driver through a travel agency. We have booked a private car to wait there for us. It took us 10 hours to drive ca. 200km to Chame. As one of the fellow tourist described the traffic “after 2 hours in the car we still weren’t quitee sure which side of the road do Nepali people drive on”. Although it may seem chaotic, this style of driving doesn’t cause conflict or frequent accidents on the roads. Generally, the people remain calm and compassionate – thanks to the Buddhist and Hindu philosophy.   After a couple hours drive, we swapped the car for a jeep in Basisahar (1043m). The jeep is required for the second part of the journey because there is only a narrow dirt road. The weather there makes it difficult to maintain roads in a good shape.  If you can, avoid driving on this type of roads during the monsoon season. Rains cause landslides and make driving and using the roads risky and dangerous. The famous “Death Road” in Peru (Yungas Road) could be easily stripped of that title by the road from Basisahar to Chame (2650m) if it was up to me. Chachare Kohl Bridge was the last one we have crossed. For the rest of the way the motto “bridges are overrated” applied. Sometimes I had the feeling that our car remains on the road just by the will power exercised by its passengers. I must admit, the ride was not my cup of tea. On the other hand, Martina enjoyed it, while Juraj even slept through some of the scariest parts. Also, locals don’t seem to mind the roads at all. It’s quite common to see a 5-seater car with 10 passengers.   Unfortunately, we didn’t make it to Chame on that day, as we optimistically planned: a truck got stuck on the road which caused a delay. Therefore we stayed in Dharaphani (1860m) in a regular teahouse. You will get to see many more of them on your trip. However, the beds were damp for some reason, so we slept on the emergency foils - pretty smart idea Juraj came up with. There was also a toilet and shower with “hot” (translate as lukewarm) water. You should be prepared for overpriced tea in all the tea houses. By overpriced I mean that it costs as much as a meal. The next day we continued our drive to Chame, passing though Thanchok and started hiking in Chame.  Chame is easy to reach (also by car) from Thanchok.   If you plan a similar trip, we would recommend you to stay in one of the tea houses in Thanchok(2700m) - it’s just a little further up, much less touristy and you get a great view of the Manaslu mountain (8163m), the eight highest mountain in the world. Of course this recomendation is based soleely on the location of the teahouse, we have no idea how the service is. But who comes to nepal for gastronomical experiences after all?

        "title": "Nepal Day 2: Chame to Upper Pissang (North Route)- Oct 19",
        "excerpt":"We did not make it to Chame (2650m) previous day, as was originally planned. Instead we stayed in Dharaphani. We got on the jeep around 6.30 to drive to Chame and started the hike from there. We passed our first police check on the way.   The hike from Chame to Upper Pissang (3330m) is not challenging, it’s mostly flat. The walk to Chame followed a dirt road big enough for cars, but after yesterdays “road trip” I was quite happy we walked. The road was partially in a cliff, like literaly. We took the north route, as we were told the views are nicer. There is an apple farm on the way, called Farmhouse Bratang. Our guide bought enough apples to last for a desert for every evening - and we were concerned about packing the most lightweight clothing back home, loosers :D. These apples are special for the locals though, we were told by them that they actually do not get to buy these apples, as all of them get exported. We stopped at Dhikur Pokhari for some lunch. Here we firstly realized how much the locals try to appeal to the westerners.   We have arrived at our destination shortly after lunch. Chame is a mix of traditional houses with few locals living in them and teahouses for tourist, that havee little to do with the traditional ones. The view from Upper Pissang is great. You get a clear view of the Annapurna II (7937m). There is also a monastery on the top of Upper Pissang, which has been recently renovated. You can walk in and participate in a ceremony or drink some tea outside for a voluntary contribution. This little place had a special vibe, at least for me.   You will also encounter prayer wheels and see many prayer flags along the way. Prayer wheels are inscribed with mantras and by turning the wheel one releases the mantras. Buddhists believe that spinning the prayer wheel has the same effect as reciting the mantras - to purify negativity, generate compassion, remove barriers to enlightenment and bring benefit to all sentient beings. ypu should make sure you turn the prayer wheel in the right direction though, namely clockwise.   You will find prayer flags on all the religious sites, spiritual places and temples. Each colour of the flags stands for an element and the colours are always in the same order: blue, white, red, green and yellow for sky, air, fire, water and earth. Mantras written on the flags are believed to be carried by the wind and spread goodwill and positive energy.   Because of the popularity of the Annapurna circuit, you might not get the mountain solitude here. However, mutual curiosity of fellow travellers always leads to interesting conversations along the way. Foe example, we have met a family with four kids in Chame. They came from Iran and were planning to hike for a month in Nepal. We spend good part of our evening chatting with them - really inspiring bunch.   On other note, I learned the importance of keeping hydrated on the very first day. By the time we were waiting for dinner, I started having really bad headache which continuously worsened over the evening. I never get headaches, not even hangover related. I assume this was due to a combination of altitude and lack of water. I drunk a LOT of water and went to sleep early. Next day I was fine and could continue hiking.   Headache is also one of the common symptoms of AMS (acute mountain sickness). We did educate ourselves about AMS before this trip, just to be prepared. Turns out, we were not as well “prepared” as other, who carried all kind of medications.

        "title": "Nepal Day 3: Upper Pissang to Manang - Oct 19",
        "excerpt":"We left Pissang around seven to “beat the traffic”, even though there was actually not that many people. We took the north route through Ghyaru(3730m) and Ngwal(3660m) and were told that this part of the trek is probably the most scenic one - which was true. Personally, I would say that was the most beautiful part of our Annapurna circuit. Also the extra altitude gained at the north route is good for acclimatisation.   As we were leaving Upper Pissang we were also leaving the view of Annapurna II. The other side, a whole valley of different scenery was opening up in front of us. We were basically following the Marsyangdi River all the way to Manang(3520m). We had a quick stop at Ghyaru. I must say I was a little disappointed how touristy it was there, but luckily the people spread out quickly along the trek.   Once we reached Ngwal something unexpected happened. We noticed a newly build stupa just on the hill and wanted to check it out. We still had some time left before lunch and managed to convince our guide to join us on this little side treck to the stupa. However, there was a little hill behind stupa that we wanted to reach once we saw it. And another one, and another… and suddenly we ended up at 4000+m. The views from up there were great. We turned around there and went back to Ngwal to get some lunch.   The scenery from Ngwal to Manang was changing pretty quickly. The last party was a flat dirt road. It was beautiful, but we were looking forward to finally get to Manang.   The accommodation our guide booked for us still had (common) showers with hot water. Well and wi-fi of course. All the teahouses we have been at had wifi. It is so normal here, that I almost forgot to mention it. I was shocked to find out that Manang was basically a shopping centre. The many small shops were selling everything from souvenirs to mountaineering equipment. Also it was cheaper in Manang than anywhere else. Thee majority of the tourists do a “rest day” in Manang - meaning they spend at least two nights there. This sometimes can result in shortage of accomodation, as some of the tourist are either comming from Tilicho lake or going there. We have decided not to go to Tilicho lake, as it would take too much time and therefore did not fit timeplan.   There is a free AMS lecture every day at 15.00, which we found quite useful. We also learned that about half of the tourists were taking medication to speed up acclimatization. We opted not to take any and luckily were fine.

        "title": "Nepal Day 4: Ice Lake circuit - Oct 19",
        "excerpt":"Rest day may have many meanings. Around here, rest day means that you sleep in the same place for two nights but you still go hiking during the day. MANY other tourist do their rest day in Manang(3520m). You can easily go shopping in Manang too, many little businesses sell all the stuff a tourist might need: from toiletries to sports equipment. It’s very cheap and most likely fake, but who am i to judge…   Based on yesterday’s  experience from our little detour, our guide suggested we could go to the Ice Lake(4600m), instead of the usual Gangapurna Lake, as a rest day destination. Bilal (our guide) hasn’t been to Ice Lake in five years, so it would be nice to do something different for a change for him too. Ice Lake lies at 4600m and requires a climb of 1050meters. The usual route starts from Bhraga, which is 50 lower than Manang.   However, our lovely guide had a great suggestion once again: we would go up a shorter route that starts in Manang and go back down to Manang through Bhraga. Basically, an “Ice lake Circuit”. When I looked it up on a map, the route was not there. This was also the first time Bilal has walked that route and it was amazing!    The views during the climb are extraordinary, a totaly different view from what we could see from the trial to Manang. Also, we were the only ones on this “path”, as it is probably not very well known (if at all). We passed by a Yak (long-haired domesticated bovid) farm on the way and convinced our guide to take yet another detour to a stupa, before we reached the Ice Lake. The stupa was at 4600 and the detour was a good call - better views and nice resting spot shortly before reaching the Ice Lake.   The way down to Bhraga seemed to be much longer to us - which may be a biased opinion since we all ashared the opinion that the way down is always worse than up. Once again, views are worth the effort without a doubt.    We came back to Manang just passed 3pm, which is when the free AMS lecture starts. We joined in and as the doctor was explaining the symptoms of AMS. Inmediately, we started to feel them all! Luckily, none of us actually suffered from AMS. It’s the same thing as when somebody says “don’t think of an elephant” - so what are you thinking of now?    Anyway, happy and healthy, we spend the evening playing a card game called “Jocker” with Bilal. We have played it every evening and once again Bilal beat us in our own game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Dec 19        Tour info      Ascent   1160m   Distance   15.1km   Duration   7:53   Moving time   4:18   Activity view   ","categories": ["hike"],

        "excerpt":"We are currently having Indian summer in Germany! Because of the sunny weekend, roads were jammed around Munich. We found schwarzenberg bike trail near Bad Feilnbach to go to on Sunday.   We started from the swimming pool’s parking lot, as most of the other parking lots were full (probably because of Appel market this weekend). Our primary mission was to disappear in the forests as streets were packed by cars and people. Once we did, the first climb of the day was ahead but only for few minutes. The forest road continues to go around Schwarzenberg peak, slowly up and down, you can enjoy scenery on your right. The climbing starts from Hundham where you take alpenstrasse. This road leads to the peak. The last hundred meters below the summit are however forbidden for cyclists (there are wooden stairs made for hikers). We had to walk to the summit - it takes 5 minutes only. There were dozen of people sitting on grass and enjoying warm and sunny Sunday.   The trail starts right after you pass by Schwarzenberg peak. Be aware, there are 2 fences for animals not that far from each other. There have at least marking to make them visible from distance. The Scharzenberg trail has a smooth start that becomes more steep after first hundred meters. We met only 4 people on the trail, no bikers. The middle part is quite muddy. We knew there will be some wooden bridges but did not expect them to be damaged and aged. There is mud all around. Also rainy days during the week helped here. We carried our bikes for few minutes. As soon as you cross the road and continue going down through the forest, the trail becomes dry all the day down. One note, there are 2 rock drops one after other that lead to muddy patch (you might have it dry). This section surprised us on blue marked bike trail (on trailforks). Otherwise all good, I would rate S1 (the rocky drops described above would be S2).   Enjoy these sunny warm days!

        "excerpt":"We slept so well last night that we were late for breakfast and left later than expected (7.45am). Acclimatization was going good so far, just for one thing - swelling. Martina and Juraj were OK, I was the problematic one. I was wearing low hiking boots but my feet swelled so much, that I could not fit my feet into them anymore (say it, fatty! lol). I would say that my feet were at least a size bigger (read as chubbier). Luckily I had a pair of winter boots that are wider and wore them for the rest of the hike.   Since we left later than usually, there was a lot of “tourist traffic” on the way. The trek itself is not challenging and the views are not as beautiful as yesterday neither. I guess you have to earn them first. Nonetheless, still worth it!   Originally we planned to stay Yak Kharta, but everything was booked out. We stayed in Letdar, just a little further. Our guide was apologizing that he was only able to book us a “basic” accommodation. This was a teahouse with no shops, beautiful views and a 3 bed room with a shared toilet and bathroom - all maintained and as clean as you can expect at 4250m. In my opinion this is plenty for “basic”.   Once we got to our accommodation we changed our clothes, had some food and left for a little acclimatization trek. We went to a stupa which didn’t seem too far nor too high. Once we got there we continued a little further until 4745m. None of us had any troubles acclimatizing. The cherry on top was the view. We could see the Annapurna I, which you are actually not supposed to see from the Annapurna Circuit. The climb wasn’t even high enough to deserve those views to be honest, we just got really lucky.   As usually, we spend the evening playing Joker. Guess who won?

        "excerpt":"Now we’re talkig! (aka hiking). Todays plan is to get to the 4880m. I have never been in such an altitude. The highest I ever got was 4005m. So yeah, we are pretty excited.   It is not possible to arrange accommodation in High Camp(4880m) or Thorong Base Camp(4190m), it’s on a first come first serve basis. We left our accommodation in Letdar around 7.30 and were one of the last ones to leave, even though it was still quite cold and frosty. I believe we acclimatized quite successfully as none of us had any significant problems. We could keep up a decent pace during the ascent and made it to High Camp in about 2.5 hours. The way to the Thorong Base Camp (Thorong Pedi) was ok. On the other hand, the path from Base Camp to High Camp was really steep.   Oce we arrived to High Camp, we were one of the first ones. The only people who arrived before us were hikers who have had a really bad experience with the lack of available accomodation at the Tilicho lake and were determined to get a good nights sleep - understandable. Also, those who had a sherpa (some carrying theer luggage) send them first, to reserve accomodation.   We had some food once we arrive to High Camp, caught up with fellow trekkers at the dining hall and took some rest before the afternoon side trek. Now, we were the only people taking a side treck. Not beecause none else was fit enough, but because there was actually nowhere to go. The only path is the one to Thorong La pas, or you can go back down where you came from. Well…we improvised. We went to the stupa close by and then decided to go up another trial just opposite the stupa. Once the path finished we continued a little further until we reached a horizon at around 5150. None of us showed any severe AMS symptoms. I had a light headache, which disappeared by dinner time.   We got back just in time for dinner. And, as always, played cards. The climate outside was quite refreshing. The opposite was true around the air close to the toilets.

        "excerpt":"We started early for our pre-work bike ride to Stoißer Alm from Traunstein with Peter. Our target is clear as we are looking at Teisenberg right from the beginning. The sun is slowly going up in the morning, it should warm us up later when we start climbing.   Once we cross A8 highway, the forest road starts. We pass by a parking lot, only 2 cars parked there. The gravel forest load leads to Stoißer Alm. There are just two parts going down for a bit where you can rest otherwise it goes up all the way. The forest road is nicely cleaned after the recent logging (visible fallen trees and branches around). The ascending to the hut took us around 1 hour. The last ascending is quite steep - connecting trail between the forest road and trail on the top. I tried to ride it all the way up but I could not manage, more practices needed :) The sun was already up, it felt like a summer day. People were sitting on the terrace at Stoißer Alm, lot of bikers visited the hut today with us. I noticed skitour route on the way there are DAV Skitour signs.  There are couple of skitour trails leading to Stoißer Alm. We shall come back this winter.   Once rested, we had to go back home quickly. Our initial goal was to descent via Neuhäusltrail. Due to time constrains, we had to chose a shorter way down. We turned left instead of right for Neuhäusltrail. We followed the top part as we climbed it, then continued down via another trail. This was S1 trail. Firstly, few smaller roots and rocks. It became more rough and enjoyable. There is one tree fallen otherwise clean.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Around Högl mtb - Sept 19",
        "excerpt":"We often see church in Anger from the highway as we ride to Munich. It is nicely light during the night. We went to explore trails above Anger - around Högl. The trail is in 8 figure, you go up and down from different side of the hill.   Höglwörther See is our starting point. We crossed Anger village with its beatufil church and we turned towards Högl peak. The ascending is not that steep as it goes zig-zag. We arrived to the highest point in less than 40 minutes. There is Strobalm but it was closed already, only few people walking around, enjoying the scenery. We entered the forest and the first part of trails starts right after. These are XC trails, you go up and down on the forest road (S0). It continues until we reached other-side of the hill. We are close to German-Austrian border. We could see Salzburg valley. We turned to left to start climbing back. This is the surprising part, the climbing back was on singletracks (they were wet, lot of roots - fun to ride even up but as the earlier descent was much easier, I would rather go down here and up there). We had to push our bikes for a bit as we also chose a “forgotten” trail (there are multiple choices here, other trails could be better, not having trees blocking the way). I did not remember reading the description of these trails otherwise we would have been going down here. As we arrived back to the crossroad below to Högl (there is a cross here), we turned right and continued through multiple forests toward Anger via trails (S1).   I would rate today as most of the way it is on S0 and that second part (both climb and descent) was on S1. There were possibly S2 trails we found around. We will return but we will definitely switch the second part of the figure 8 as described above: descent via singletracks and climb back up via XC trails.

        "title": "Nepal Day 7: Thorong La Pas - Oct 19",
        "excerpt":"We made it though the Thorong La Pas(5416m)! To do so we had to get up at 3.30am in order to leave little past 4am. Most of the people in the packed teahouse left round the same time, but luckily it spread up quickly.   The climb itself was not challenging at all. The only challenge was the cold, it was - 9°C until the sun came up. The Thorong La Pass was a little disappointing, since there are almost no views from up there. Nonetheless the feeling of accomplishment is quite satisfactory once you reach the 5400m.  We didn’t stay there for too long because of the cold. However, the next day I have noticed on the map that there are lakes close to the Thorong La Pass - maybe something worth checking out. We didn’t know at the time, so we didn’t go.   Once we started the descent, we warmed up quickly. The descent is quite long with no teahouse or toilets on the way. Also, it’s not so easy (read impossible) to find a friendly bush up there. The first restaurant we came across was at around 4000m.   You will pass by a monastery and a temple just before entering Muktinath. The entrance looks almost like a garden. It has been very busy when we were there, as many locals were completing their religious rituals at that time. According to our guide, it’s always that busy.   Muktinath is very small and no cars are allowed into the town. Ponies and motorbikes are used for transportation, but you can easily walk everywhere. We did some shopping, you can get here pretty much the same things here as you can get in Manang, but you will pay at least 30% more here. We tried to buy bottled coca cola in Muktinah,  but after we were offered an expired coca cola bottle for the third time (all in different shops), we decided to go to a bar. Out of sight, out of mind.   We went to the Bob Marley bar and were pleasantly surprised by the nice atmosphere and good music. If you bring a flag, they may hang it up in there as decoration.   Muktinath is the last destination for many travellers before they return to Kathmandu. Many of them buy their bus tickets here. We have decided to fly from Jomsom instead, which requires one more day of walking or catching a bus. We also came across a bike rental place, who will take your luggage to Jomson while you get there by bike. The bikes are not too bad, so maybe that’s something to consider if you don’t feel like walking anymore. In any case, whatever the transportation mode, for the greater parts of the journey you will be using one and the same road, the only difference is the time needed to get to your destination.

        "title": "Nepal Day 8: Muktinath to Jomsom (via Kagbeni)- Oct 19",
        "excerpt":"I thought that this day would be about getting from A to B, no major adventures involved. Well, I was wrong! Once you leave Muktinath you have to walk on the side of the road for most of the trip. In about half way, you can either go straight to Jomson or take a detour and visit Kagbeni on the way. We left the choice up to Martina, so (of course) we took the detour. I was personally not dying to go to Kagbeni, but retrospectively I am glad we did.   Kagbeni is a village like I have never seen before. It is very small, full of old unchanged buildings and has a monastery from the 15th century that you can visit for a small entrance fee. We  walked around for a while and headed towards Jomsom around noon. Some bikers advised us to go to Jomsom as early as possible because the wind gets “unpleasant” on the afternoon. Well, “unpleasent” was the understatement of the year!   The way from Kagbeni to Jomsom is 11km. It goes either though a dried out river or along a car road. With car road I mean a wide sandy dirt road. In combination with the wind, pretty dusty. The further from Kagbeni we went, the stronger the wind was getting. After about 3km it was pretty dramatic. I felt like in an old western movie. We pulled our buffs up our faces, pulled our caps as low as possible and filled the last empty spaces on our faces with sunglasses in order to avoid getting the sand everywhere.   The first couple of kilometres I thought that we must have gotten lost because no one would ever voluntarily walk that path. However, as soon as I saw 2-3 other groups walking in front of us I realized that this was the actual path. We eventually made it happy and healthy all the way to Jomsom. A hot shower never felt so great!   Evening program was as usual - cards.

        "excerpt":"I found good rated bike tour around Brünnstein where I have not been yet. I was in Sudelfeld with Danka the previous year. We did not go to Brünnsteinhaus but turned earlier to cross Austria to go to Thiersee.   I found free parking lot at Winter-Erlebnispark Bayrischzell. I passed by Sudelfeld Schwebe ski lift as the bike trail goes through it and continues via forest road (it’s ski way back to the lift, it is used during the winter by skitourers as well). It started to be steep after couple of minutes, not the best warm up. There are 2 parts that are steep with loose rocks, otherwise ride-able. The forest road leads to “Unteres Sudelfeld”. I crossed the ski slopes and turned to the first trail of the day, rated S1. It was muddy, wet but enjoyable all the way down (compare to the ride we did a week ago). I met first people after I completed this trail and started cycling again on the forest road. It goes all the way to Seelachen Alm. After the Alm, I turned to rocky S1 trail that became also steep. I had to push the bike for couple of minutes.   Once you reach the highest point of the day, there is a trail leading down to the forest road (Wanderweg 655) to Brünnsteinhaus. This was the last part I had fun today. I stopped by for a break at Brünnsteinhaus. It is still opened. The disappointment was when I found the way down completely flat, it was made probably only recently. What I climbed I just cycled down on brakes. No rock, root or any sort of fun. The turning point for me was when I climbed back up to the other side of the valley and saw Brünnstein. I realized right away I should have taken a shorter path. This came after I met couple of hunters. They made me stop 3x as their cars stopped, they talked to each other and continued after a minute or so.   I reached Wirstalm sattel, the second climb done. There are man-made stairs, with sharp curves, rated S3. I just carried the bike over these to cycle a bit where I could. Right after there is S1 trail until I was back on another forest road. This one led me back to the valley. I continued via cycling path along the road back to Bayrischzell.   If you want to repeat, don’t go the way down from Brünnsteinhaus as I did. Find a better path. I’ll look at maps to find better escape trail.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Around Hochries mtb - Oct 19",
        "excerpt":"This week was full of bike trips. Yesterday bike tour was quite demanding for me, it was mainly due to steep climbing sections with rough terrain. Not to mention, I almost cut my shifter cable on the second climb (had to repair it). I was expecting less demanding tour today. Unfortunately it was not, bike tour around Hochries takes about 5 hours and ascending +/- 1600m.   The tour starts in Aschau. We found a free parking at Festhalle. There were lot of bikers starting their tours as well there. The start is easy, compare to yesterday when I started climbing steep forest road after 5 minutes on bike. We cycled through the valley along the river, crossing it multiple times. The bike trail is almost flat until Sachrang village. This is where first climbing starts.   As soon as we gained some meters, mountains around showed themselves. There were plenty of people and unfortunately also cars (these cars were going to/from Goglam). We were looking foward to a moment when we leave the crowd. It came after Goglalm. There is rocky forest road above Goglalm - this is the moment you leave the crowd. Once you climb this forest road,the long traverse is visible. This is S0, sometimes S1 forest road (one part is S2, there is a sign you should push your bike). Once traverse finishes, we need to go down to loose our gain, upset part is that this is just a forest road.   We are climbing again to Schwarzrieshütte. We pass by the hut and this is where the singletrack starts (one of many waiting for us). S1 going up, many hard-tail bikers going the opposite direction. The ascent become more steep after a while. We are losing our energy quickly and stopping by for refill. Once we get some energy back, we continue towards Feichteckalm. We are convincing ourselves the second climb is over soon.   We pass by Karkopf. There were strong winds in the afternoon today. The trail goes up and down until the crossroad below Hochries. We decided to follow the proposed track instead of going through Hochries summit. We were after food and rest more than summits at this stage. We descended until we pass by a cottage. This is where the “flow trail” starts, beatiful traverse S1 trail that goes all the way to Riesenhütte. We missed the note that this hut is closed due to renovation (as I read it, it shall be opened in a year or so, the work has not yet started). We continued down via the forest road, finding some smaller trails along the way. We finally found a hut opened - Hofalm. After a short break, we go down via Milli-trail. It is currently covered by leaves which hide all the rocks and roots from eyes. It has lot of surprises. There were dozen of people descending this trail.

        "excerpt":"I have been in the bike saddle most of the time in the recent days. We used every spare evening or weekend to go on wheels. The Indian summer was surprisingly long and sunny. The last Saturday was different as we decided to go to Salzburger Hochtron. You can spot the lift station from the highway when entering Germany. There is a rock wall that you do not need to climb (you can though) but rather just cross via a hiking trail.   We started at Glanegg. There is a parking lot, paid, where already at 9 am we found the last remaining spot (cars already parked along the road). There is winter closure for the Dopplersteig trail. The fixed lines are down in many places. This however did not force people to hike during such sunny Saturday. We were meeting lot of people on the trail going up.   The Dopplersteig ascent is nice. It starts to go along the stream with many waterfalls and then it opens and you are looking at the rock wall and wondering where are you going. The moment that might scare few people. We walked on wooden stairs, the elevation gain is quick here. We were at the crossroad after 2 hours hiking. Taking here the right trail that leads to the rock wall. The most interesting part of the day. The most of fixed ropes were down for the winter. We pass by Zeppezauerhaus and going up to Geiereck first. Not crowded on the top, we continued to Salzburger Hochtron. Berchtesgaden, Dachstein and others can be spot from here. And also black crows not afraid of people, flying around us.   We descended to Zeppezauerhaus for a short break. We found out this was their last day for 2019 season, they will return in 2020. We got lucky today. We returned via Reitsteig, much easier to descent here. There are lot of stairs, in the first kilometers. It took us around 1:45 hour to go down to the car.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Zwiesel trails mtb - Oct 19",
        "excerpt":"When we hiked to Salzburger Hochtron yesterday (I will provide report later this week), there were 2 near peaks in our interest. Zweisel and Hochstaufen. We spotted a ridge walk between these two. What about mtb in this area? There are plenty trails starting from Bad Reichenhall. Our plan was to follow as many trails as we could in one day.   Our start was at 9am from Noon parking lot. It was crowded already, we found one of the last spots free. The climbing starts right from the parking lot, no warm-up again as our pulses went up within first minutes. We reach the top parking lot where we turned to the trail - our first for the day: Padinger Alm Trail. This was very good warm-up, S1 trail down.   We continued to Zwieselalm, ascending around 500 meters. We continue on the gravel road until it its end. This is where the trail with made stairs goes up Zwieselalm. We turned back to lower down 200 meters. Jochberg trail - this is S2 with some S3 parts sections. These 2 trails are short (total around 300m). We got back to gravel forest road and we were climbing again.   This time easier, Jochberg Rinnerauer trails. I would rate them as S1. They finish at the parking lot near Höllenbachalm. We go lower to enter forest again. We are on Jochberg trail after a short climb. Very good S1 flow trail with few natural mini wall rides, smaller drops. After the trail we are climbing to Thumsee trail. This is another harder section for the day.   Thumsee trail beginning is S1 traverse (narrow and very steep hill below), sometimes some S2 sections until we reached the zik-zak descent. this is S3 in few places. This trail is quite deep, I once hit the rock with my pedals. One section is on the rock, you recognize it via cable there. I believe this was the hardest section of our day. We descended down to Thumsee.   We crossed the road and entered Seelbach trail, it is S0 forest road following the Saalach river. We did not check where this trail continues so we went lower to the main road. We turned left in the village to start climbing to Bürgermeisterhöhe. The initial hundred meters are steep forest road. We turned to a trail that become very difficult to be ridden. Full of leaves, rocks and roots. We were pushing our bike for 30 minutes to reach the top part of Bürgermeisterhöhe. This is also not easy for pedaling as it goes up and down, sometimes with bigger roots/rocks in the ascent parts that just stops you completely. We rested on the top, there is a spot with a bench with Zwiesel &amp; Hochstaufen views.   Bürgermeisterhöhe descent was another highlight of the day. Couple of switchback sections with drops right before or after. I would rate this as S2. It finishes in the town at a parking lot. We cross the town to get back to our car.   We collected so many trails within few hours, unbelievable!

        "title": "Berchtesgaden small round extended hike  - Nov 19",
        "excerpt":"There was a bank holiday 1st of November in Bavaria. Friends from Slovakia came over and we decided to visit Berchtesgaden national park for this 3 days weekend.   Our hike started at Königssee, Jenner ski lift parking lot. Friday was sunny day, at least around Salzburg as it was foggy all the way from Munich. Our proposed plan was to hike up to Carl von Stahl hütte where we would stay for one night. The hut is opened all year, it can be booked online. Based on our pace and weather, we wanted to go to the surrounding peaks the first day. The second day to continue to complete kleine reibn - round hike tour.   As we started almost at noon, we anticipated we might not be able to go much further from the hut. Our arrival was after 3pm, we had to sort out the room and we could go for a short walk for a sunset to Pfaffenkegel. We managed to get back for the dinner.   We decided to extend small round hike to go to the opposite end of the Königssee. I could not find boats going there but map shows some trails going around the hike. This was one of our surprises that day, more described below.   Our second day started after 8 am. There were not much people going up to Schneibstein in the morning. The peak had 5 centimeters snow cover, it snowed 2 days ago. As we were going higher, the temperature was dropping. As result we were putting back on our layers. The temperature at the top was just 2C. Therefore we did not stay long at the summit and continued towards Seeleinsee. We saw only 2 more hikers in front of us and later 2 hikers behind us, otherwise just us on this trail. As we were walking, we noticed dozen of Chamois.   One moment, we thought we were looking at another Chamois. This time it was a dog. Suzi from the hut. She joined us. We did not know what to do as we were far away from the hut and had to continue our trail to make it for the last boat. She was leading and showing us her home. We increased our pace from Seilensee, as we knew there is still quite a trail ahead.   The last descent was challenging sometimes as trail was covered by leaves and lot of streams crossed the trail. We lost hundreds of meters within a hour or so. We were finally standing at Obersee, still 15 minutes more to Königssee. We realized our proposed path might not be ideal as there was almost a wall in front of us. What do we do? We explored other options but none were ideal but we had to move as soon as possible, only more than a hour left before the sunset. Note, the hiking trail we did at the end is not recommended. We lost the trail for some time. Unfortunately, this is where we had to traverse steeper sections above the lake. The leaves made it more difficult as they were all over and we did not know what is underneath. We were progressing slowly here . After this challenging part, the rest was fine - narrow trail most of the time. Our relief started as soon as we reached Kessel. We made it in time for one of the last boats to get us back. If we did not manage this one, we would have to walk in the dark via unknown trail. There was also stream where we could drink water. We were quite happy to be on the boat right before the sunset. We returned Suzi to her owners.

        "title": "Bad Tölz: Zwiesel trail mtb - Nov 19",
        "excerpt":"The very last minute visit was planned on Friday. We agreed to go for hike and bike on Saturday - find a trail that can be accessed by a bike and also by foot. Browsing the map, I realized I haven’t yet descend from Zwiesel. It is marked as black diamond singletrack.   We were two groups - me &amp; Lukas on bikes. Danka, Katka and Palo on foot. They started from the Blomberg lift station and we started from Bad Heilbrunn. Our plan was to meet at Blomberghaus. It took us 1:15 hour to get to the hut. It is opened during the weekends now. The last part of the gravel road leading to the hut was covered by snow, otherwise it was snow free. The temperature was good for outdoor activities, much warmer than in the previous days.   Once we rested at Blomberghaus, we continued biking to Zwiesel. We reunited again here on the top of the summit. There were couple of bikers at the summit. The beginning of the trail was covered by snow, not much though as the last warm days melted most of it. Once we entered the forest, the trail was dry all the way down almost. The first part is curvy S1 / S2 up until the meadow where you continue to left. The flowy trails led us to more rocky sections. The trail becomes harder S2 / S3. There are couple of turns that are quite sharp but possible to switch.   The trail varies to our liking. There is one passage that we carried our bikes down for few minutes. Back on the bikes and lot of roots again until we got back to the access road.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Kampenwand mtb round - Nov 19",
        "excerpt":"Although it is almost the end of November, the weather was playing along for some biking. I did a round tour around Kampenwand. Actually the route was more like 3 little rounds below the Kampenwand.   The first part was actually not a very exciting one - I maybe would skip it the next time. Little urban biking from the parking lot and some forests. The second part was really nice. Not all to easy hike with great views, some little S1 descents. The last part has the most singletrials, easy ones. However, they were covered by leaves which made it impossible to see the surface and the whole thing was very slippery. Surprisingly, I met quite a lot of bikers that day.   The most exciting of the day was the weather, ironically. While it was totally cloudy, foggy and cold in Munich, it was sunny and relatively warm in Aschau in Chiemgau. I was actually wearing a short sleeved shirt on the way up, pretty sweet taste of summer just before winter.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Hochgern hike - Dec 19",
        "excerpt":"The last weekend  we spent with friends in Traunstein. We decided to go for a hike on our way back on Sunday. Hochgern is on the way, a hut opened all year. Good for starting the winter hikes again.   The starting point is in Markquartstein, there is big parking lot where the forest starts. Estimating time for Hochgern is 3 hours 15 minutes. We wanted to make it quicker and possibly to do a round tour. As it snowed in the last 2 days, we were not certain about the conditions up there.   The hike start on the forest road. We later changed to a regular access road. There are few shortcuts you can do, so not walking on the access road too much. We followed some trails. They look nice for bikes (S1), we will explore this area with bikes the next year. It is now too cold. Although we have met few bikers today.   The snow started above 1000 m.a.s.l. The road was covered by ice as well. We did not need crampons though, walkable all the way up to Hochgern. There is much more snow below the Hochgern hut but as so many hikers go to the hut, the path was clear. Danka was glad that winter started again with snow all around us. It started to be more challenging after the hut. There was 15-20 cm of snow, plus wind helped to cover your tracks and made our faces beaten by hard snow flakes.   We reached it after 2:10 hours. Our pace was good. As we turned around at the summit, the trail was covered by snow again, that was quick. We descended back to the hut where we stopped for a quick break. Due to the snow and time, we decided to abandon our proposed round hike, and returned the same way down.   It was just below 4 hours once we reached the parking lot. Much faster than we expected.

We decided to go to Grubereck (1664 m.a.s.l) von Kreuth. The hike is relatively close and easily accessible by a car. It was pretty cold, despite the fact that we started around midday and it was a sunny day. It is December after all.   There was barely any snow below the three line. Once we crossed it, we finally got to walk on the fluffy white stuff. So much fun! First snow of the season make us always so happy. Since it was Monday and the snow was fresh, not many people have walked the track before us. Therefore, it was not icy and we did not need to use crampons.   Overall, very nice and easy track with rewarding views.

        "excerpt":"Wendelstein is considered a must do tour while in Munich. So we decided Anke should not miss this one. Luckily the weather played along and we were able to do it.   Our original plan was to start in the morning, but we failed terribly - for no reason in particular. We just kinda had a nice stress-free breakfast and it took some time. Finally, we started at noon again. At least it was nice and cosy by the time we started walking.   The ascent below the tree line was snow free. There was snow cover above the it. Partially it was slippery and shoe chains came in handy.   The descent was a bit trickier. By the time we were coming down, most of the previously snowy parts have become icy. Challenging, but doable if one walks carefully. By the time we got the the parking lot it was dark already.   Another great day with great company, and more to come.

        "excerpt":"Happy New Year everyone!   Still a snow-less winter. It calls for another hike. But hey, stay optimistic, winter eventually will have to show up at some point… Martin is glad as it is as he had an accident in December and might skip this winter season due to longer recovery period.   The start of the hike is from Hohenburger parking lot. We starting ascending on a dirt road, which lead to a forest path later on. You will pass the Lengries Hütte after 1.5 hours of walk, or so. Then its another forest path all the way to the ridge. The views from there are great. We were lucky and had clear to see all surrounding mountain ranges.   We have met the first skitourers of the season here. They probably started from the other side, otherwise they would have had to carry their skies from Hohenburger parking lot for about a hour. To be honest, we were a little jealous watching them shred, but happy for them at the same time of course.   Nonentheless, the lack of sliding motion lead us to use some plastic bags to descent the mountain towards Lengries Hütte. So much fun! We felt like kids again. Watch out for the stones though! When we got back to the hut it was crowded. We got a bier on the sunny terace and left.   We took a differnt path for the descent. Hiking spikes came in handy as some parts of the forest path were completely icy. Before we knew it, and after many but many “servus” we were at the parking lot again. A nice day out.

        "title": "Fann mountains: Big Allo lake to Iskanderkul, part 3 - Aug 19",
        "excerpt":"I haven’t managed to complete part 3 of our Fann hike in 2019. Time to resume in 2020.   25.7 - We were just 8 kilometers away from the Big Alo lake. We started early as usuall to reach the lake by noon. There were only two tents above us. More hikers came the next day. All people we met continued down the valley back to the civilization.   26.7 - We rested for a day here. We enjoyed water, sun. The plan was to move to Smaller Alo later in the evening. We were wondering where is the hiking path on the left side of the lake. The path is visible but only partly. It disappears where is rocky terrain. We started moving later in the afternoon. The path definitely ended and we had to find our way. Bit of scrambling, jumping and we were on the other side of the lake. It was slightly challenging with backpack sometimes to get up and down. The rock was loose, we were couple of meters above the lake with heavy backpacks. We noticed couple of rock statues but that was it, no hiking path to follow. We camped above the lake. As there was not any good camping spot around the lake for all of us.   27.7 - Our target is to get through Dvoynoy pass. There were couple of passes on the left side where we wanted to go. We initially wanted to go to a closer saddle but we realized early enough it is not Dvoynoy and we need to go further up the valley. The snow started 500 meters above us. The path to the saddle was completely snow covered. It took us 5 hours to get to the saddle. The views beautiful. As any other day here. The Biryuzovoe lake was still under snow. Our proposed plan was to sleep at this lake. But once we saw it from Energia few days back, we knew we won’t sleep there as there is still too much snow. The way down was much easier, snow was melting and was quite stable, neither deep. As we descended couple of hundreds meters, the rocky terrain started again. There was path sometimes. We were just going down as fast as we can. Once we reached the valley, we noticed goats and sheep. There were local shepherds. They were very friendly and invited us for tee. We had wonderful tee break. The eldest could speak Russian. They even shared their food. We were nicely suprised and offered them our sweets.   We were back on feet and continued descending. We got to the river. There were two bridges to cross and one river crossing was just big rocks. We had to go around as there was no passage along the river. We went again up to meadows. We were already tired and were looking forward to dinner. We reached a camp site place in the evening. There was nothing solid earlier. This was our longest hike (entire day on foot, 10 hours moving time). We were very happy to be camping and get some rest overnight.   28.7 - Iskanderkul time! This was definitely not easy as I pictured it. There were few challenging spots along the way. First, the trail is above the river, steep terraing to cross. There were soil/rock slides that destroyed the trail. It was quite narrow or sometimes we were creating our own path. Second, the damaged bridge. Check the picture below. It was reported few years back in russian trip reports. The wild river below us and in front of us - few trees tied together with large spaces between. Trees were wet, one was even broken. Fortunately, We managed to pass without any issues. The surprising moment for us was when we saw a man on another side of the river. There was no path there, we could see how difficult it is to make one step for him. He was far away from us to talk to him. He might have wanted to avoid crossing the bridge, who knows. But from our perspective, the terrain was very difficult and he was quite high. Any mistake there might lead to sliding dozen of meters down to the river.   We saw man-made buildings in the afternoon, civilization! We were day-dreaming about beer and food as we realized we will be soon enough in Iskanderkul. The first people we met were “doctors without borders”. One of them was Slovak girl. They invited us to their home stay where we had lunch with them. It was well deserved beer and lunch. Thanks to the doctors! We managed to get a taxi to get us down to Iskanderkul. We did not want to walk on the road. People were greeting us and they were offering services. The first civilization shock. The second were  mosquitoes, they were very annoying and persistent. We had to get our bags that were transferred from the Alaudin camp. Once we obtained them, we moved to Snake lake. It is above Iskanderkul and it was vacant.   29.7 -  The accommodation was OK, we at least had a small tant for all of us where were no mosquitoes. There were too much mosquitoes outside, however the scenery was nice! You can potentially fish there and also swim. We tried local fish but did not like it much (not sufficient portion mainly). Instead of staying one more day or so, we decided to go to mountains again. Mosquitoes were the most decisive factor. We managed to find a taxi to get us at least to the new mine. There is lot of going on because of this mine. Lot of machinery, loaded trucks constatly going. The taxi driver left us close to the mine as the dirty forest road ended there anyway. We started hiking and searching for a camp spot as it was getting late. We found a good place in the meadow. There were couple of rock buildings but no one anywhere. Just us. This is the beginning of our hike to explore Hissar range. I’ll cover this hike in another post.

        "title": "Mangfall mountains: Taubenberg mtb - Apr 20",
        "excerpt":"Being inactive on our blog in the last weeks due to not an easy situation for all of us. Much appreciated we can at least do “non-adrenaline” activities outside. The last weekend we decided to do a cycling from Aying. It was our first time visiting Taubenberg area. Our starting point was Bildham Tierpark. The parking lot is closed currently. The first surprise was after the village Aschbach, where is 17% grade. We realized we will need to return the same way. Luckily for us, it is quite short and not that steep as it looked at first. The way goes up-and-down often, but always up-and-down parts are short.   We crossed Mangfall river and we started cycling along the river. The forest road, or sometimes trail goes along the river for about 8 kilometers. As we crossed the river the second time, we made a mistake to continue along the river. The trail looks good from the start (a false reason to follow it), however there are lot of fallen trees later. We carried our bike too many times. After a while we were looking for escape path. If the trail would be clean, it would be definitely fun (S0-S1 trail). After we crossed the highway bridge, we climbed our way to Oberdarching where the road starts. It is just 5 kilometers until reaching the Taubenberg forest road.   Climbing Taubenberg is short (less than 200 ascent meters to the top) but rewarding - the prealps peaks are visible. We continued to the descent part. The trail starts almost right-away from the top. It is quite short and we joined again the forest road. It goes all the way down. Our next stop is Seehamer See. We made a short stop here and continued back to our starting point. The way back is not much entertaining compare to the beginning. Most of the way are asphalt or meadow gravel roads. The last climb that we were so afraid was few minutes of pedaling and wondering later why we had imagined it to be much steeper.   Anyway, good ride with one section to be avoided and some other sections to be found (there are couple of possibilities for descent from Taubenberg) !

        "excerpt":"One of our first mountain bike rides is always Gindelalmschneid. The ascent to Gindelalmschneid provides sufficient steepnes to make us sweat and the descent trail is easy, aligned with the current situation we are facing. There are many possibilities for mountain biking in this area, we even changed our track on the fly today. We decided to go up via access road to Gindelalmschneid, not via a trail to Huberspitz.   As we started, Danka began pedaling harder to overtake two cyclists. We kept this pace for the entire climb. It was quite exhausting, legs need more training. There were couple of cyclists around Gindelalmschneid. We took a short break and continued to Neureuth. I like the forest road, it goes up and down through the forest. Neureuth is closed as we expected. Our next detour was here, I planned to descent via 683 hiking trail but we took 681a. It is the forest road- S1 almost half the way down, later changes to a gravel road until you reach Tegernsee village. This last part is steep asphalt road.   Once we get down to Tegernsee, we followed the cycling road along the Tegernsee to get to the Prinzenweg biking trail. This bike trail leads back to Schliersee. There are only couple of shorter climbs, most of the way back is on a forest road or road through meadows. We met more cyclists here than up in Neureuth.

        "title": "Hissar range: part of our Fann mountains adventure - part 4 - Aug 19",
        "excerpt":"The last days of our hiking in Tajikistan. We completed the Fann mountains cross hike and ended up in Iskanderkul. As I mentioned in the part 3, we did not want to stay longer in Iskanderkul as we did not like it much. We rather went to mountains again.   30.7 - we wake up in middle of meadows. The weather is as any other of these 3 weeks - sunny. Quite stable weather here as promised. We cross these meadows, searching for a path. It starts and then disappears. We stick to the river and follow it. Once in a while we turn our heads back to see Fann mountains, Energia visible from here.  We reached almost the end of the valley later in the afternoon. There is snow above us (100 meters higher) and we know we will be traversing some glaciers tomorrow. It was not that simple to find a good camping spot as there are lot of streams and not much dry flat ground but we managed go find one. Lot of saddles are visible from our camping spot. We search for our saddle we want to cross - Nadezda saddle. Initially, we thought it is further up and there is already a glacier by looks of it but no, it is the closest saddle on the left.   31.7 - this was supposed to be a long day as we should be crossing glaciers and go through the three saddles. We start early in the morning, and ascending fast to Nadezda saddle. There are trails visible, we follow some from time to time. We are walking on rocky terrain, bigger rocks from time to time and approaching the saddle, no snow yet here. We reach the saddle after more than 3 hours hiking. The views are incredible, the next valley is covered by snow and glaciers, our path is visible from here and we are exploring how glaciers moved and checking for cracks. The terrain is most of the time flat compare to previous days. We all get ready for glacier crossing. Another 3 hours of walking and we are sitting at the second saddle of the day. This is easy, isn’t it? White pyramid peak is visible finally, also the saddle Usko that we would like to cross later today. However our moral is lower today as usual. We arrive below Usko saddle where we decide to camp. We do not have strength to go up and then down to find another camping spot. There is no camp place here however, full of rocks, snow just 30 meters from us, so we create our own camping spot. Using ice axes, we dig rocks and make a ground flat for our tents. Later in the evening we are talking about possibilities for the next day. The conclusion is to go back to the civilization and split. Part of us go to visit the capital city Dushanbe and the second part stays in mountains a bit longer and we all meet in Panjakent. We enjoy the scenery, so many peaks around us. Once the sun goes down, it gets very cold as we are very close to glaciers. We experience one of the colder nights.   1.8 - we do not want to get out of our sleeping bags as we know it is freezing outside. We slowly wake up and make breakfast. Soon enough, we are descending down through the valley. As usuall, we are jumping over streams, crossing rivers or jumping with heavy backpacks over big rocks. It is our routine for 3 weeks. We harry up to make it to the Iskanderkul today. We anticipate we can do it but need to be in a hurry. The worst part of the day, actually there are two parts.  First, mosquitos attack close to the Iskanderkul. We jump into hundreds of them, and twice as we loose the path and have to return back a bit. Another one is when we are at Iskanderkul and ascending from the lake up to the peak to be able to get to the village. It is already late afternoon and sun is very strong. There was nowhere to cover for a minute, just keep going to get this over with. We manage to hitchhike on the road leading to the village. This helps us a lot to get to the camping site and rest. We do not manage to find a proper ride to Dushanbe - people offer their services but for a high price (what we consider high, it is unexpensive but we know they are way over what could be reasonable) so we are going to try our luck and hitch hike our way there. We are here for an adventure, aren’t we?   2.8 - we start walking on the road, hoping to hitch hike. We got lucky again but not that much. The truck driver stopped and let us hop on to the rear part. It was full of dust (they haven’t cleaned the rear part for years) and it was covered all around so not much fresh oxygen during the ride. I quickly regret choosing this idea and just holding tight and counting minutes. Not much fun but thinking of it now, all went good - what an experience. As I stay attached to the front cabing. My friends are in the rear part. We are all covered in dust (breathing was hard) and do not know what is going on outside as we do not see anything. The road was not an asphalt road, curvy dusty road often just for one car so stop, let something pass and move again. We were jumping and going from left to right, like a roller coaster ride.  I am so happy once the truck stops. We know this is time to hop off. We survived! We end up at the main road, leading to Dushanbe. We stop another car, all 3 of us are able to fit in with backpacks. The main road leading to Dushanbe is another adventure. It goes through mountains so up to above 3000 meters and down again. There is the Anzob tunnel. What an experience! The dark place full of dust, holes. Once we cross this tunnel, there is a new asphalt road to the valley, safer as the other part. We arrive early afternoon to Dushanbe and start exploring the city.   3.8 - We are staying in Dushanbe and exploring the city. It was worth coming here, different type of city. We event met one local guy who can speak Slovak. What a surprise!   4.8 - return to Panjakent. We get a shared taxi to Panjakent. The driver knows the road and drives quite fast overtaking any other car, even in the well-known Anzob tunnel. Scary moments but managable. We meet with the rest of the group in Panjakent. The next day time to cross the boarder and be back in Uzbekistan. We stay over in hostel in Panjakent. The one we liked before - Salom hostel. Our friends are already there waiting for us. The crossing border the next day goes without any problem. Taxis are waiting on Uzbek side. Negotiate price again and we are back in Samarkand where we stay one day and time to fly back to Europe.   That is it! I hope I provided sufficient details for someone to follow similar tracks in Fann mountains. You can download gpx in komoot (the real tracks) or proposed track on alpenvereinaktiv. There are couple of worth checking blogs written in English from earlier 2010 years that could help.   Thanks to my friends for this superb adventure. It was great and I go back in my memories often, happy to made it the last year. We would not be there this year most probably.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Hochries mtb trails - Apr 20",
        "excerpt":"Originally we had planned a tour that was crossing the border to Austria, which was not ideal due to the covid situation. We changed the route on the fly and took the Panorama trial instead.   The first climb was the longest and hardest. Once we reached the Riesen alm, we took a trial followed by a short (but steep) climb leading us to the aforementioned Panorama trial. Very rewarding views. You might find plenty of fallen rocks on the road below Karkopf. Also there were patches of snow but very little, just making us all look muddy. From Feichteck saddle, the descent continues through the forest all the way to the the Doaglalm. The trial was in mediocre condition due to the many fallen trees, but someone was removing them at the time already - thank you! Otherwise technically easy: some rocky parts, some roots, some drops - most of the way S1, some parts S2. There was only one section were we carried our bikes. Good fun!   The rest of the trip was basically just getting back to the car. We took forest roads, that were partially concrete and some easy trials. This was actually  unexpectedly nice. The occasional small climb kept our heart rate going and the trails were a welcomed reward.   There are multiple “Alms” on the way and we cant wait until we can actually visit (when this will be allowed again).

        "title": "Mangfall mountains: Breitenstein mtb trails - Apr 20",
        "excerpt":"Well, well, getting up at 6 am when you finally get a day off (bank holiday here in Bavaria) is not ideal, but sitting at home is even worse.   Martin chose a bike round around Breitenstein. The first and largest climb to Kesselalm was really steep. Lets be honest, it was hard work (without getting off your bike or stopping). We traversed to Aiblinger Hütte.   The descent was really fun though. It starts from the Aiblinger Hütte. Some parts were tricky due to the wet roots which are super slippery. The trail is S2. Once we descended, we started climbing again using the cycling trail leading to Schwarzenberg. This is where the second trail of the day awaits. The first part of the Schwarzenberg trail (S2) is fine as the last year, but unfortunately the second part got worse as Martin recalls. We carried our bikes couple of times, since there were fallen trees along the way. It was totally muddy and not maintained. We carried our bikes for most of the way. Luckily you can easily avoid it by taking the road at the crossroad - there is only one. I wish we took the road earlier! The second part is much shorter than the first, so you won’t miss much.   The trail ends on a cycling path that goes around Schwarzenberg. This is ca. halfway though the whole round. From here on, the way continues on cycling paths all the way to the parking lot. There are some smaller ascents, but no more trials.   Back at the parking lot, one can get a treat from the bakery. They are open and serve everything to go. Get’em calories!

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Kampenwand trail hunting mtb - May 20",
        "excerpt":"Weekend mode on! This one is social, as finally some of those restrictions imposed due to corona are getting a bit more relaxed.   We did a tour that we have been on before (however not all trails) - exploring trails Kampenwand. The ascent was a mix of gravel and concrete. We were unplesently surprised about the amount of cars going uo and down (all coming from/to Aigen parking lot).   This time we changed the track, because there was an S3 trial we wanted to do (attempt to try) - Lieben Frau - upper and lower part. And we did! Danka carried her bike basically the whole upper trail part through the mud, but with style and smile. None of us wanted to do the section again, so I guess that it an indication of its quality currently. The lower part is S1, all good fun. We got back to the gravel road and started descending (at least 2 detours for Eibbergtrail). Most of them is S1, there are few sections with sharper bigger rocks that requires concentration or speed.   After this little detour we went wanted to climb more so decided to go to Gorialm. The climb is fine, with some steep sections - mostly gravel or concrete. It gets quite steep towards the end. The descent from there starts a bit down the road. After being couple of minutes on the road with hands on brakes, we turned left to Reitweg trail. Its rated S2. Fun single trial with rocks and roots. The trial goes almost all the way down to the Aschau, but its separated by little sections where you have to take the road - actually a great place to rest for a little. We could feel our arms and legs!   That is all. Happy weekend everyone!

        "title": "Chiemgau alps: Traunstein weekend mtb - May 20",
        "excerpt":"The weekend with Peter and Barbora in Traunstein area. The first day just a short ride to Stoißer alm as we arrived later in the afternoon on Saturday. The peak is close to Traunstein, you can bike and no car needed. As soon as we cross the highway, the ascent starts. We follow the local roads until the historical border between Salzburg and Bavaria - interesting spot. We turn right here to the forest. The forest is quite soaked due to recent rainfall so we are deep in mud sometimes but still managing to move forward. We arrive to Stoißer alm, where we take a short break. I remember the time from the last year when we cycled here but it was quite busy, not like this time. Although it was busy as plenty of bikers here but the Alm is still closed due to corona. We go up to Tausenberg. There are short trails on the descent (S0-S1). We are back on the forest gravel road and going back direction Traunstein.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Stoißer alm mtb - May 20       We planned longer bike ride on Sunday - Röthelmoosalm bike ride. It is Rupholding official bike trail, marked as such as well. There is only short trail, most of the way is on the forest road. We start from Rupholding, following the river Weiße Traun. We go along the 3 lakes, enjoying the views in the valley. There are lot of cyclists here, crowded valley compare to mountains around. We cross the road at Weistee and start climbing towards Röthelmoosalm. It is much more crowded, lot of hikers and cyclists here. As we want to do more climbing, we do not stop at Röthelmoosalm but continue the same direction up to Hinteralm. We basically go around the small stream, going up and down. We get a closer look at Hochgern at Hinteralm and return back to Röthelmoosalm. From Röthelmoosalm we go to Urschlauer Achen river. There is short single track going down. We join the road and following it until Rupholding. There is one good spot on the way, climbing garden. We shall return here another day.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Around Hochgern mtb - May 20",
        "excerpt":"Martin planned a trip around Hochgern with a backup option to bike around if its too busy up there. By the time we arrived, the parking lot was PACKED. Black Friday type of packed. We ended up biking around Hochgern in the hope for less people. Good call!   This is the official bike trail, as shown on the map - 1 + 5 trails combined. We slowly started ascending. The takes little over an hour to reach Jochberg. There is short S0 singletrack leading to it, with great views. As Alms were finally opened, we couldnt resist but to stop for a break. The descent is mostly gravel forest road. First 400 meters lead through a meadow, this segment is rated as S1. You could possibly prolong this by another rial, but it is a short one again.   Once you bike around the hochgern you get the view of a really nice valley created by the Weiße Achen stream. You also get to see Rötlwandkopf is on your right.  We are astonished how deep the valley is. The descent is an S0 (basically road), with plenty of loose rocks. There is a cross road for getting to the Vorder-Alm. Martin notice that there sould be some additional single tracks, according to our navi. Once we got close to Vorder-Alm the views opened up with Hochgern on the left and Hochfeln already beehind us. Soon we reached another cross road where we took a left to enter the forest and a trail section. This was a really nice climb, an S1 trail. It leads to Staudacher Alm. The hut is surrounded by rocky mountains. We have to admit, it was so nice that we has a little photoshoot there. The descent from here is via the Schnappenkirche trail, S1. It becomes wider hiking path with lot of rocks, a bumpy ride all the way down to the parking lot. There are couple of shortcuts in the forest (S1 with some S2 drops). The trianl gets you back to where you started. We were noticably happy after the trial, really fun section.   It is possible to do this in the opposite direction. We will most likely be back to do this, now that we found some extra (official) trials up there.

        "title": "Benediktbauern to Bayrischzell multiday mtb - May 20",
        "excerpt":"We have been working from home for the past months and felt the need to leave the home office. Luckily some hotels and guest houses have started opening up, so we used this chance to plan a weekend get away at Tegernsee.   Martin suggested a two day tour from Benediktbauern to Bayerischzell, with a stopover at Tegernsee. Our friends were up for it, so we joined forces - with respect to the corona restrictions, needles to say.   We parked our cars at Benediktbauern and headed toward Lenggries. It is 750 vertical meter over ca. 25km, where you do most of the climbing in the first 10 km. The climb leads over a gravel road and is moderately steep. Most of the way leads through a forest and opens up on the end, reaching the Kirchsteinhütte. From there we descended via the Jägersteig which ended with a short uphill segment were we had to push the bikes. A gravel road leads from there all the way to Lenggries. There are couple of options to descent, we chose the one that ended at the Lenggries bikepark. Some of the kids who ride there have serious skills.   Some of our friends had to return to Munich but still found the time to help us by getting our cars from Benediktbauern and leaving them at Tegernsee. Without them, we would have needed to take the train to fetch our ride. So huge thanks, you are awesome!   Meanwhile we (Peter, Martin, me) continued our trip towards Tegernsee. We still had around 1000 vertical meters left, spread out into two climbs. The descent for both was a gravel road. The first one (Stinkergraben trail, S2) was a little steeper and the descent little dissapointing - really muddy. We had to carry the bike multiple time, over small segments. Not ideal but doable end enjoyable if you dont mind some muddy “sun spots”. Of course here is to consider, that it has been frequently raining in the past two weeks.   The second climb was flater. Nonentheless, whe had to push the bike towards Hirschberg as bikers are restricted from using the upper part. It is a particularly nice and peaceful area, so we did not mind walking. On the other hand, the descent (not a part of the restriction anymore) was great. Flowy, playful and really really long. It was quite late by the time we were descending, so there were hardly any people on the trial. The temperature seemed to be proportional to the number of people on the trial. Our hand were pretty stiff from the cold. Maybe it is a good idea to carry a second pair of bike gloves for such a long day, so one can wear the dry one for the descent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Day 1 - Benediktbauern to Tegernsee - May 20       The second day consisted of three climbs. The first climb was via Prinzenweg towards Sagfleckl. The ascent is gravel and really nice, going along a river most of the way. The descent was pretty short, but very nice. Its rated S2, but most of the trial felt like S1, except a short segment with large loose rocks. Then the descent continues via Prinzenweg connected mostly via gravel all the way to Krainsberg. The second ascent start shortly before reaching Krainsberg. Its is a little flatter and the views are really nice. The descent is via shorter trail (S1) down to Schliersee.   Finaly, the third ascent starts from Schliersee to Spitzingseesattel via Bockerlbahn. The last part leads via a car road, which is not ideal. There is also another way through the forest. However, we are not sure if it is suitable for bikes. The way from there is gravel and mostly descending all to Valepp. The  Valperstr. is really beautiful. we hope to return and to do this part of the trial again, in the other direction (descent via singletrack S2). We followed a cycling path called Rund ums Sonnwendjoch to Bayerischzell. Towards the end, the trial goes through a forest and has a really nice flow. Good way for our end of the day.   Meanwhile Borka, once again, saved the day. She picked up her car and drove from Tegernsee to Bayerischzell to wait for us, so we did not need to think of how to get back to our car. She is a hero! We feel well rested after the mini holiday and ready to embrace Monday, which is a bank holiday. Such a good start into a new week.

        "excerpt":"This post will be short, as was the trek. We wanted to do a quick recovery trek after two days of mtb and chose to go to Leonhardstein. It looks impressive from the valley and we have been passing by for a while now. The time has finally come to check it out!   The trek start from Kreuth village, below Tegernsee. There are red markings from the parking lot all the way to the summit (marked well). Note, it is rated black due to the scrambling part close to the top. The first half of the ascent is either gravel or wide trial. We noticed that bikes are allowed on that segment. It looks like an S1/S2, so we will be back soon. The second half of the ascent is a lot steeper, partially scrambling but no special equipment is required. We have not met many people, however the rocks and paths looked like they have seen a fair share of visitors. The views from the summit are great. This would be a perfect spot for watching the sunset.   There is no other descent option besides the path we came up on. We did the whole trek in about 2:30 hours. Really nice trial if you are looking for something short and a bit more adventurous. Leonhardstein actually looks quite impressive from the valley as well as from the summit. We will be back soon, next time with bikes.

        "title": "Karwendel extended mtb round  - Jun 20",
        "excerpt":"4 day weekend, what a treat! We planned something special for this occasion, namely a 3-days MTB tour through Karwendel, Bardenberg Alps and Bavarian Prealps (weather forecast for Sunday was 15L of rain). Karwendel Alpine Park is the oldest and the largest park in Austria, comprising a surface area of more than 700 sqkm - and riding bikes outside of cycling paths is basically forbidden. Nonetheless, this tour is totally worth it! It is challenging though - physically and mentally. Some of the climbs are pretty mean.   Day 1: Fall - Karwendelhaus   The tour and our first stage started at Fall, a small village close to Sylvensteinsee, where we also met with Peter and Borka. Our first destination was Karwendelhaus, via Vereiner Alm. Our motivation was put into test once we had to cross a little stream - the Fermersbach. The water was ICE cold and the current so strong that wheeling across the stream was out of the question. Let me tell you, this is not how refreshing feels like. My feet were (ironically) burning from the cold. Anyway, this was a little teaser of the suffering to come later, I guess.  We had our first (well deserved) break at Vereiner Alm, after some 30 km &amp; 700 m elevation gain. Then we descended back to Mittenwald. Up to here, the roads were mostly gravel with, well, mediocre views. I mean, the views were actually nice, but they cannot be compared to those yet to come. By the time we left Mittenwald, it was around 17.00. We still had ca. 25 km to and 850 vertical meters left to travel. Firstly we needed to cross the whole Karwendeltal. All seemed so nice and peaceful - cows lying on the meadows with precious sunshine throwing light at impeccable mountains. And then…. BAM! A little dot on the top - which seemed too far and too high was Karwendelhaus. We actually managed to bike all the way up and reached our destination around 20.30. We kept looking back into the valley, the views are great from there, especially on a clear day like we had. We missed dinner time, but still were kindly offered spaghetti bolognese, but a hungry eater is a good eater, after all. There were not much people up here to our surpise (good for us).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Karwendel extended 3 days biking trip - day 1 - Jun 20       Day 2: Karwendelhaus - Guffert Hütte   The second stage, consisting of another 70 km and 1500 vertical meters, led to Guffert Hütte via Plamsjoch Hütte. It was VERY pleasant to start a day with an easy descent surrounded by amazing views. All the suffering on the day before was not for nothing! We reached our first climb some 2.5 hours later. We could see the Pflamsjoch Hütte from below. That stage, in contrast to the previous one, was really hot in terms of temperature. This basically drains the energy out of you. At some point, we were passed by two little girls on e-bikes and I must admit I did feel a little jealous. On the other hand, they won’t get a Radler as a reward at the end. I think we basically developed a Pawlow reflex by now. See hut - do pedal - get Radler! The descent from here was a little steep, with some loose rocks. Totally doable, but not so much enjoyable. Also, this is a quite busy road for hikers and despite of being wide you may encounter situations where you have to come to a full stop. After some lunch at Achensee, Martin couldn’t resist but to dip in the water, despite the fact that it was really cold. The cold water has not stopped the many tourists on the beaches from enjoying the weather though. I can understand, the scenery is impressive. We actually caught ourselves making future holiday plans at Achensee, not long after reaching it. It basically sells itself and it is very convincing! Anyway, once we were done making holiday plans, swimming and observing kitesurfers, we biked to Achenkirch. Here we split from Borka and Peter.  Borka had to work the next day. She is a doc, so Saturday is a relative term for her. Martin and I continued towards Gufferthütte. We run out of water right at the beginning of the climb and, admittedly,  I started getting pretty  “hangry” as well. At such a (low) point, anything that happens is basically Martin’s fault. Sorry, Schatzi! Luckily, he is very peaceful and it’s almost impossible to have an argument with him. Believe me, I tried…many times. Finally, we were pretty happy to have reached Guffert Hütte. Funny enough the corona restrictions here were quite different from those at Karwendelhaus. But who are we to judge who does the right thing or not. We basically keep our distance, wash our hands and try to avoid touching anything at all times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Karwendel extended 3 days biking trip - day 2 - Jun 20       Day 3: Guffert Hütte - Fall   The third stage, finally! I tried to convince my brain that we are “just getting to the car” at this point, even though I knew that we were making a detour to Rotwandlhütte (not Rotwandhouse). Why? I don’t even know anymore. Anywho, the day started with a descent all the way to the German-Austrian border. Nothing special really, just a gravel road. Once we crossed to the German side, we had to carry the bikes for a little climb. Then we biked uphill on a single track (probably S1). This part was really beautiful and quiet. One can only imagine how flowy and fun it is in the other direction. Maybe next time! Not long after,  we reached the BaySF trial. It’s not steep enough, so quite a lot of pedalling is required to reach a fun speed for the obstacles. In case that is too much effort, an alternative concrete road is built next to it. From there we followed the Weißbach and Achenseestraße, some 20km. Last but not least, we have reached the starpoint of our final - some 700 vertical meters. I may be a little biased, but this one seemed endless. Luckily, in contrast to the previous climbs, it ended with a flat segment. I always prepare for the worst and an easy finish cheers me up. The views from the top are spectacular. Totally worth it! Despite all this amazing nature, we were ready to go home and shower. The descent was a real descent - no hidden climbs. We got directly to the parking lot where we left three days ago. By now the smallest things made us really happy - like old spare shoes we left in the car or that can of tuna for emergencies.   Believe it or not, this trip was not just for fun, as usually. We wanted to test our (dis)ability to bike with heavy backpacks for three consecutive days, to kinda imitate what unexpected things can come up during longer trips. We have been playing with the idea to do a 6-7 MTB trip with some friends for a while now. As expected, unexpected things did come up. We are physically ready, but our equipment may need some adjustments. Martin is getting new insoles for his shoes  and I will be getting some proper MTB shorts. Also, our tan lines are getting pretty ridiculous - 50UV sunscreen has its limits too, not sure what the solution would be for this…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Karwendel extended 3 days biking trip - day 3 - Jun 20       Tour info      Drive   1:00 hour   Start   Parking lot at Fall, few free spaces at the end of the road   Duration   3 days (for better timing see komoot)   Activity view   Day 1: Fall - Karwendelhaus     Day 2: Karwendelhaus - Guffer Hütte     Day 3: Guffer Hütte - Fall    ","categories": ["mtb"],

        "title": "Davos mtb weekend - Jun 20",
        "excerpt":"The weekend weather forecast around Munich did not look promising. Most of our friends were out of town as well. Martin got an idea to check the weather further from Munich. Davos looked promising and the accommodation we found earlier this month was also available. Time to visit “Home of trails” region. What a throwback! This is where Martin and I lived together for the first time. Martin came from rainy flat Cambridge and I came from rainy flat Belgium. Hilly, snowy Davos was a very welcome change. I got a research job in Davos at the Snow and Avalanche Research centre. We lived in a small Studio on a farm and would wake up to the rooster in the garden every morning. Not to forget the “homely” smell, which one gets to miss once its gone. Such a different life back then. Everyone who lives there is an outdoor person. Everything evolves around nature, literally everything. “Sorry I am late, I was skitouring” was a valid argument for showing up late to work, especially when the weather was good. The only downside was that I was a full time student at the same time. Yup, along with the full time job, this involved countless sleepless nights. However the Davos lifestyle was worth it. Its like a different universe there.   Anyways, this is also the time when we got into MTB properly. We always used to ride and enjoy the mountains, but Davos brought it to a different level. I used to borrow my brothers hard tail bike from a brand called “cocaine” (yeah, i have never heard of them either). I did love that bike though! Also, I had no idea that the telescopic post was a thing back then. Martin got his first proper MTB bike by the end of our time in Davos and thats when it all started. We found the magic that was hidden below meters of snow - all the single trials. The weirdest thing of all - MTBikers are not frowned upon here. I would even say MTB is encouraged! Obviously this has to do with how the bikers behave. Many riders are locals who are basically riding in their back garden. EVERYONE takes care of the trials and is super respectful. There are no conflicts between hikers and bikers, even though they often share a very narrow path (in both directions!). If something is (rarely) forbidden, everyone follows the rules. Plus, it’s clear which restrictions are actually valid and which are not, unlike in Bavaria. In Bavaria, there is a tendency to put up restriction signs, despite the lack of approval from an authority. But that is a story for another day…   Davos Epic Trail   We were staying in Davos Monstein. There is a local brewery with very good beer! Finding trails around here is so simple, which makes choosing which one you want to ride all the more difficult. We made plans to do the Davos epic trail on Saturday and Albula haute route on Sunday.   In the morning, we rode from Monstein down to Calvendel. There is a forest road and it basically leads all the way through Rinerhorn ski resort. In the spirit of “human powered adventures” (and as a matter of habit) we climbed up. The alternative would have been to take a lift, which everyone else did. We were the only poor suckers who decided to climb a 900 vertical meters even before the epic trial officially started. I still loved it! Even though the last section was so steep, that we pushed the bikes. Don’t get me wrong, we did try to cycle up. The problem that we were so slow, that at some point we basically fell to the side. This gave us more time to enjoy the views though. By the time we got to the start of the epic trial, I had the feeling that we deserved it.   The trial itself was almost snow free, except three smaller patches. When Martin  did this section two years ago, they had to push their bikes though one large snowfield, which took some time. Despite the good “snowless” condition, I still have managed to faceplant. It was such a perfect act at such a pathetically small patch of snow, that I couldn’t stop myself from laughing…along with 5 other bikers who witnessed this. Other than that, the trail was almost empty. We only met a couple of hikers and bikers. The trial is rated as S1 and leads to Sertig Village.   Sertig valley is a magical place. You can go hiking, climbing, ice-climbing ski-touring and mountain biking here - probably on the same day too! We have been here on a skitour once and have seen a pretty large avalanche. I take the pride on deflowering Martins avalanche virginity, he has never seen one before (and hopefully will never be in one, ever!). Ironically, the avalanche that we have seen was triggered by a guide with 4 guests. Luckily no-one got hurt, but I would have sh*t my pants if I was them.   Back to topic: From Sertig, a singletrail (rated S1) goes up to Rinerhorn. Once we reached Rinerhorn, we took a much needed break. The next trail ahead is 335 Monstein. This part of the day was the hardest. It contains a lot of climbing sections with bigger rocks and wet roots.  I am joking about it now that, like a Ferrari, my bike has a low bottom bracket, but I wasn’t laughing much back then. Actually, I was imagining throwing the bike of the cliff in my head over and over. This is because my pedals were constantly hitting the rocks when I would pedal and it was driving me mad! Therefore I pushed most of the section. It got to a point where I renamed the Epic Trial to “Epic Fail”, while Martin tried to keep a safe 5 meters distance from me at all times. But don’t worry, there is actually nothing wrong with the trial. We just learned that the length of the crank arms on my bike doesn’t work for such terrain, and confirmed that patience is not a strong suit of mine. The Oberalp section was closed for now, we had to go around using the official 335 trail. It took us a while to get down to Monstein.   Still pretty mad and blaming Martin for the choosing “epic fail” trial I was determined this was it for today, no more biking. Nonetheless, Martin convinced me to continue to 338 Zügenschlucht. It was supposed to be much easier compared to what we already have done - not to mention the Landschaft there! We left Monstein at about 5 pm. Our goal was to catch the train at 7 pm from Filisur, to be able to have dinner in Davos Monstein (restaurants in Monstein usually cook until 8-9 pm).   The short climb was easy, a forest road. It goes down to Zügenschlucht. The descent down to the george is S0 with some S1 trail parts. There are a lot of train tunnels. The trail leads down to Wiesen train station. From here, the trail continues, following the river. It is quite exposed. Sometimes due to previously washed up parts of the trial or just for being more narrow at some places. We ended at Landwasser Viaduct, not far from Filisur, one short climbing section only. We got to Filisur just before 7 pm, as planned. The train back is worth taking! We went through tunnels we saw earlier and were able to see the george from a different perspective. I was constantly running from one side of the train to the other to see it all. The ride itself takes just 15 minutes to Davos Monstein. We had to prepare ourselves for the last ascent, back to Davos Monstein from the train station - 230 meters ascent at the end of the day. This happens when you start your day with a descent…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Davos epic trail - Jun 20       Panorama trail   Our initial plan was Abula haute route but we had changed it, due to the Landwasser part. We went back to Davos and did the Panorama trail. We have done this before, but in opposite direction. We parked at Davosersee parking lot. It was a pretty good warm up to bike through Davos before reaching the climb. As soon as we turned right after Parsenn lift station, the climbing started. The first half of the climb is easy. However, it starts to be difficult at the middle lift station. There is a gravel road with bigger rocks, which is very steep. Me, as a strong believer of never-push-your-bike, had no choice but to hop off and do the dirty work. It became less steep just below Strela pass, where the Panorama trail starts. Considering that the weather was not great, we were almost the only ones on the trial. The sun came out later in the day. Our original plan was to go to Parsennhütte, but we had to cut it short and descent at Meierhofertäli. Martin’s ankle started to hurt. Meierhofertäli trail is black diamond, rated as S2. I was little concerned it would be too difficult, but it was actually great. So much fun! Martin got a flat tire half way through the descent. Except the flat tire and couple of steep switchbacks with rocks, there was no problems what’s so ever. The trail goes down to the Davosersee.   Pretty happy with how the day turned out, despite the rain in the morning, we were ready to go home. Davos is great, we will be back, hopefully for longer next time!

        "excerpt":"We go to the mountains A LOT. On bikes, on foot, on skis, we even climb them sometimes. However, we have never been on a ferrata together, even though there are plenty of options close to home. It was about time to fix it! And, since we had some Bergliebhaber visiting us during the weekend, we thought it would be nice to do something special, as our visitors have never been of ferrata either.   Martin chose an easy one, namely Elmauer Halt. The ferrata itself was quite different from what I had expected. You know, I imagined we would be hanging of huge clifs with nothing but a little ladder below our feet - for an easy ferrata, and climbing style ascent for a difficult one. Understandebly, it was really hard for me to grasp how people go up and down using the same “path”. I was quite far from the reality. Nonentheless, it was really fun and physically much more challenging than I though. Which makes me question: have I been using wrong muscles or is everyone else who goes to ferratas really ripped? I could not walk for three days, not to mention to sit down or to get up. Also, I recommend wearing long pants if you are not experienced, if you don not want to look like you have been attacked by a tiger.   The ferrata itself started from the Wochenbrunner Alm. There is a small fee to use the last ca. 500 m of the road. We arrived quite early, so there was no problem with parking. However, the parking lot was packed on the afternoon. From Wochenbrunner Alm we started hiking towards the Gruttenhütte and then approached the ferrata. The views are simply tip-top! On a good weather day you get to see the whole Ellmau valley with Kitzbühel range on the background on one side, and a rock cliffs on the other. The latter is where the ferrata goes though, but it looks more intimidating than it actually is.   Among my many false believes about ferratas was also that a ferrata set is mandatory, which is not the case. Nonentheless, all of us had the full equipment. I actually rented it from DAV - for half of our 6 person crew - for a very decent price. This was the first time I used DAVs rental service (Martin or other friends rented it for us). At the same time I learned that they have pretty much everything in their inventory. Just make sure you get to the Servicestelle at least 30 minutes before closing, unlike I did, otherwise you will end up being in the store after it is closed. Getting those mean looks from the employees was not that plesant.   All of us were quite pleased to have the helmet, as we have noticed couple of rocks falling down and heard a rather large “Steinschlag” warning. As for the ferrata set, I ended up not using it, but felt quite comforted for having the option to clip in if I wanted to. Most of the other people we met also used full sets, except for a few hikers who opted for not having any ferrata equipment at all. However, it was quite obvious that they were no beginners. Still no excuse for not having a helmet!   Overall, this was a very rewarding trip. We had great time and we learned something new. I liked the ferreta so much, that I ended up buying my own ferreta set and I am looking forward to do another ferrata soon!

        "title": "Tegernsee: Nesselscheibe trails mtb - July 20",
        "excerpt":"We have not been able to cycle afer work in the last weeks. The situation changed this week for Martin at least, he went trail hunting around Nesselscheibe, Tegernsee. The goal was to ascent 1000 meters and descent 2 different trails.   The first kilometers are on the bike trail around Nesselscheibe, leading to Breitenbach. The first small trail to ascend and descend down to the forest road. There is a crossroad, where you can continue on the Bad Wiesseer höhenstraße or take a steep shortcut. I took the shortcut that is steep (above 13 % often) gravel road. As a result, I lost a grip sometimes. The storm was coming from the left, it forced me to pedal faster. I was able to avoid the storm, as it went in a different direction. Lucky me. The last dozen meters to Nesselscheibe are full of roots, I pushed here most of the time to save some energy for descent. The top trail part is full of mud. I got 20 cm deep into it with my front wheels. However, the trail is dry all the way down. It is quite a nice forest trail with a lot of smaller trails going around (I would rate it as S1, at least two section S2). Also trees are closer often, providing many curves to go around them. The tricky part became where there is a sign for bikers to dismount. This section is steep, loosy rocks and also it was wet this week. I understand why there is a detour to the left and also the warning sign. If you do not dismount, do not break much here.   I reached Marienstein and cycled back to Nesselscheibe using Wasenkogel forest road. It is steep at the top part, otherwise fine to ride all the way up. There are a couple of trails leading down from Wasenkogel. I chose the most right (S1 most of the way, the end of the trail could be S2). I even ended up on a completely overgrown road that is not used much, it is advised to stay to the left rather than follow my track. I enjoyed the earlier Nesselscheibe trail than this alternative I took. We shall try the next time to take a different trail down.   My rear tire pressure was too low for the roots and the tube inside, I again ended up with a puncture, at the very end of the trail. It is time to sort out the new tubeless tire.

        "title": "Schliersee: Gindelalm trail mtb - August 20",
        "excerpt":"This was the first ride to Gindelalm this year, we usually visit this part much earlier. I had it planned 3 weeks ago but the storm came and  I rather stayed home. This time was traffic the only problem, somehow Miesbach got completely jammed.   The usual starting point for these trails is Alpengasthof GLÜCK AUF. There is huge parking lot in front of the hotel. The climbing starts once you get through the village. There is also another parking possibility but it is higher and the trails go to Schliersee side. The climb is challenging to do without any pause, there are only few spots where it flattens. I was checking the paths down on the way up, they cross the access road multiple times. As I reached the top, I took a short break and started descending for the first trail of the day. As it was already evening, there was no one on the trails. Something so rare there days, or not?   The first part is full of roots, loose rocks. There is also stream going down the trail for a while. I rate this trail as S1. The second part has 2 tricky section (S2 possibly). It starts with couple of stairs and then lot of roots, drops and bigger rocks. Afterwards it is much easier and just continues all the way down. The last part is the easiest. It is forest road most of the time. The trail ends at the access road. I returned back to the road I went up. From there, you can turn to the Huberspitz (just going straight). The second climb of the day awaits. It is short climb, around 160 meters to ascent. The Huberspitz is opened only in the afternoon (until 17). I again made a mistake and I planned a different trail than I initially wanted. I went down using S1 trail leading to Breitenbach. It is steeper trail as it goes directly down from time to time, no tricky parts here just keep going down. I followed the cyling road from Breitenbach until Abwinkl to reach the starting point.   It was good afterwork ride but the next time I will choose a different descent path from the Huberspitz.

        "title": "Lenggries: Geierstein trail mtb - August 20",
        "excerpt":"Danka is away this weekend therefore we decided to go for a bike ride on Friday late afternoon. We previously cycled through Hirschtalsattel during our short trans bavaria ride but we have never cycled to Fockenstein or Lenggrieser Hütte. The Fockenstein alternative was more challenging and the one we chose this time.   The ride starts at the Hohenburg parking lot, the usual place for hikes to Seekarkreuz or Geierstein. It was almost empty, it is a good sign there will not be many people on trails. The access road has been cleaned just recently. There are visible damages from the recent flooding. Well done, thank you! However, the last part to Hirschtalsattel is still closed. There is a sign at the junction with another road leading to Schlagkopf (see the gallery below. Note, I expect it to be opened soon, so once you read this, the road might be opened. Just FYI). Use an alternative way to Fockenstein. We followed it as well.   We take the unplanned access road which is leading to our planned trail anyway. As a result, we skipped Fockenstein trail. After the short climb we got to Maximiliansweg. We still needed to cycle through another access road for a few hundred meters. It ends and the trail starts going up. There are a dozen of stairs, also some fallen trees in one section. Hop on and off often here. The actual biking trail starts at the meadow with a hiking sign post right below Geierstein. The left hiking trail leads to Geierstein. Our descent trail goes straight to the forest.   The beginning of the trail is a flowy traverse. Roots start to appear sooner than later. I would rate it S2 (the traverse is S1 but once it gets steeper, more S2 sections there) The worse just awaits. The middle section is the critical part or rather said challenging. The trail here is full of loose gravel, sharp turns with natural or man-made drops. It could be fine for us but as it is steep as well, we decided not to try our limits. We tried a couple of times to ride it but it was very demanding and we were not properly physically prepared (the reviews were more positive and encouraging). We need more practise to come back and enjoy it.   The trail becomes easier as we got lower. Once the forest ends, there is a meadow with a great Brauneck view. From here it is just S1 later S0 all the way back to the parking lot.

        "title": "Tegernsee: Neureuth trails mtb - August 20",
        "excerpt":"The Neureth bike ride was planned during the week to avoid crowds but due to workload we did not manage to go. We postponed it to Saturday morning although the weather forecast was not looking promising.   We started early in the morning from a parking lot near train station Tegernsee. The Neureth access road from south starts to be steep after the hiking parking lot (the last accessible parking lot. It is usually full in the morning but not this time). I rode the uphill section to Neureuth the previous year, but I did not realize when I planned it this week. There is another access road from the north that could be less strenuous (we shall try the next time). We pushed a bit, cycled a bit. We reached the hut in less than an hour. The place was not crowded, it could be due to storms reported to come later in the afternoon.   From Neureuth, you have to first go through the meadow to enter the forest. The last time I took the wrong turn and descended down a trail that was full of fallen trees. Just follow the hiking trail. There are two or three intersections so be careful where to turn (there are at least 2 other possibilities to choose different trails down). The trail itself is in very good condition, rated S2. It is a rooty trail containing also rocks with moderate switchbacks.   Once we got down to the lake, we took a turn soon after we passed our parking spot. We could have used Prinzenweg to go up, but as I did not realize it earlier we were riding on a different uphill access road. The beginning is 23% road for 150 meters or so then becomes less steep. Although it usually becomes less steep so it is still much easier than the morning ascent to Neureuth. The Leeberg trail is easy to find. The trail is rated as S2. There are a couple of drops, otherwise traverse down with a couple of harder spots.   We all concluded it was fun!

We started from the bottom stations of Schliersbergbahn, Schliersee. There are a couple of spots to park for free or there is paid parking at the station. The access road to the top of Rohnberg is gravel.   The ascent is quite straightforward, going to the top station and just continuing on the forest road. There are at least 2 ways to get up to Rohnberg. We wanted to try the first turn from the forest road, it is a shorter way to Rohnberg. This one is steep and it is damaged due to harvest machinery. I suggest taking the forest road and getting to Rohnberg from the right side.   We first descended via Rohnberg south trail (just keep on the left most of the time). The beginning was fun, a lot of roots, sometimes double track but most of the way via singletrack. There are couple of jump boxes that looked in good shape but we did not try. There are a couple of alternatives to descend (quite a number of turns to take). The latter trail we chose (after Taferlmoos) was an old trail that is not much ridden these days, also full of water and mud. I would rather continue on the forest road and take a second turn to the right. There is another trail (I’ll need to ride it to see if the conditions are better).   We descended down, but not completely to the Schliersee. We were following the small stream until there was an intersection. We started climbing up again. The first part of the climb was steep but it was later better as soon as we joined the access road leading to Rohnberg (this is an alternative access road). This time we did not get to the top of the summit. We rather started descending via another trail below Rohnberg, going straight down. This is it! It starts as a rather wide flat trail. However, we were soon enough on the singletracks going down with some more interesting parts with drops or steeper sections. The most fun of the day on this one.   The trails are S2, some parts are easier (S1).

        "title": "Garmisch: Estergebirge (Ester mountains) 2 days hike - Aug 20",
        "excerpt":"We did not explored Ester Mountains so far. We only hiked/skitoured to Wank peak, but we never gone further east from Garmisch Partenkirchen. The mountain range look rather scary from the valley, like where there are hiking paths up there? However what is behind the wall is a completely different picture.   Day 1   We planned to do this hike during the week when there was a better chance to get a sleepover at Weilheimer Hütte (old name is Krottenkopf hütte). There is no booking system but you have to call to the hut to book it. Danka unfortunately had to cancel at the last minute due to work duties. It was just me, Peter and Borka. We started at 11 from the parking lot in Eschenlohe. The parking is for free. It was almost full when we got there, even though it was Thursday morning. The first 1 hour of hiking was on the forest access road. After that, we were ascending on a trail where we started gaining more meters. Note, this is where we got lost for a good half hour. We were talking and we just kept going until we realized we were off our course. We got back but it took us some effort to find a way back to the trail. We got to the first saddle of the day, where we finally saw Pustertal and Hohe Kisten ridge. The trail from this seddle to to  Pustertal is an easy traverse, one rocky section is fixed with rope. We stopped at Pustertal for a short break, there are couple of picnic tables with benches.   We ascended to the next saddle below Hohe Kisten. We finally saw the hut where we were going to sleep over and also Krottenkopf right above it - the main summit of this trip. The path from now on until the hut is a traverse going just slightly up and down. It tooks us a less than a hour to get to the hut. As the sun was shinning, we stayed on the terrace outside until dinner time. The winterraum due to corona is closed but as we were a bigger group, we were placed there. Luckily for us, as it was just for us. It is quite small, there are 5 beds available with a furnice and 2 chairs, that is it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ester mountain hike, Day 1 - Aug 20       Day 2   We first got up to Krottenkopf right after breakfast. This is the main summit of our hike with great views all around. So many peaks are to be seen: Karwendel, Wetterstein, Beneditkwand and many others. We descended back to the hut and we continued to Bischof peak. The Bischof ascent from the hut side is interesting as the regular hiking path goes around Bischof. There is a trail leading to the summit however it is not that easy to spot from below (it is marked on the map though). There are a couple of slightly exposed spots but nothing extraordinary. The next target is Hoher Fricken.   We walked on the ridge until we got to Hoher Fricken peak. The sun was above us, nowhere to hide from it here. We decided to descend down to Esterberg-Alm from Hoher Fricken. It was just a short detour and this was the closest alm we could find. We were still considering to go up to Wank but we decided we rather go down to Farchant and go home. You can take the train from Farchant, do not need to go to Garmisch. The train took us back to Eschenlohe, where we walked back to the parking lot.   The second day was easier as it was mostly descending with two shorter ascents: Bischof and Hoher Ficken. We could do the next time with Wank but possibly the opposite direction.

        "title": "Bad Tölz: Rechelkopf west trail mtb - Sept 20",
        "excerpt":"We had very good weather on Friday-Saturday this week if we compare the previous days. The visibility was great, we were able to see Karwendel on the way down to Prealps. Rechelkopf is one of the closest peaks from Munich with very nice views. We hiked to Rechelkopf the last winter. The hike is a short one, to do almost in any weather.   We parked in Greiling where the road access ends. There are few spots to park. It was empty in the early morning. We started slowly, warming up our bodies but we soon enough were looking at the road sign: 22%. Not something we want to see that early after the start. Our first thoughts were like we did not have enough 2 weeks ago where we were pushing our bikes often. This time the ascent was better as we cycled to the point where the double track forest road became a singletrack, no pushing or carrying our bike so far. We put our bikes on our shoulders and we were walking up until the crossing with Rechelkopf hiking path (the one that most hikers use and we will use as well for our descent).   Once we were on the hikers path, we continued to the top on foot. We were lucky to have such great weather that day. Karwendel peaks were visible. There is a sign on the top, the meadow to the east is forbidden for cyclists. As the note states, someone in 2018 scared the herd and that caused the owners to close it for mtb.   The first part of the descend contains drops, man-made stairs (some S2 parts). As this is also the main hiking path, there are always some hikers going up. The trail later becomes wider and easier (S1). There is a turn on the right to the forest (steeper section with many roots) and we got back again to the forest road. Once we got lower, more and more gates blocked our descent - the least entertaining part for us. Note, there are many of gates in the second part of the trail. Their placement is often right after stairs or some steeper sections where you just end up in front of the gate. Not everyone might like this trail because of this. Or is there any other alternative?   We got to the point where it is a warning sign about a steep descent (Not forbidden, just a warning about not being suitable for bikers). This is probably the best section of the trail. There are steep parts with a lot of roots and few bigger drops. We wanted to cycle back and go down via the north trail. We eventually decided to keep the other trail for another time. We descended down to the valley and we followed the cyclist road back to the start.

        "title": "Tegernsee: Wasenkogel and Holzeralm trails mtb - Sept 20",
        "excerpt":"I returned to Nesselscheibe this week to do alternative trails. I spotted a few the last time on the way back, they looked more rough compared to what I planned before. The starting point is in Bad Wiesse, at Breitenbachtal. There is a parking spot for at least 10 cars, free.   The first 1.7km are along Breitenbach, then take the turn to the right. This is the ascent road to Holzeralm. It is less steep than the other alternative access road (if you turn later), much better! There are trails crossing this access road (we will descend via them). The last hundred meters or so is a singletrack in the forest. You can climb it on your bike, it is not that difficult. I realized soon after where I was. I recognize this meadow, it is right below Wasenkogel. The place where I was 3 weeks ago. I took a short break at Wasenkogel. I met at least a couple of bikers descending Holzeralm trail on my way up here.   The first descent is the Wasenkogel trail. It consists of two parts. The first part is easier. There are a couple of drops, roots and some rocks but only a few. The second part is steeper, wet and much more roots at the end. See the gallery for details, I took a couple of pictures.   The trail ends at the intersection where there is a signpost. I turned left here, it leads back to Holzeralm. I already went up here so I remembered the last part is the most demanding. As I was approaching Holzeralm, there is less light every minute. I was pushing myself a bit more to be able to descend the planned way or if needed, I could take the access road down as a safety alternative.   I only took a short break at Holzeralm. Again no one here, just me. The sun is already behind the mountains. The first two parts of the upper trail are fine with enough light. However, it became much darker in the forest later and I had to use the light. The lower part of Holzeralm trail is more rocky than the rest of today’s trails. Once I descended down to the village, it was already dark there. The days are way shorter because the sunset is now at 19.48.

        "title": "Garmisch: Alpspitze hike - Sept 20",
        "excerpt":"Let’s return back to September. We took the day off on Friday, to avoid crowds in Garmisch and to enjoy finally some warmer days. Our start of the day was very early as we arrived to Grainau at 6 am. The main reason was the hike takes the entire day (activity time is 10 hours). The first steps were towards the Kreuzneckbahn station. We passed by the station and continued towards another lift station: Alpspitzbahn lift station. We saw the first people arriving from the valley. From the station there is a hiking path leading to the Alpspitze south ferrata, just 15 minutes away. We took a short break where the north facing ferrata starts There were lot of climbers training here.   The ferrata through the south face of Alpspitze is rated B/C. There were already people ahead of us, we had to wait from time to time. As we were approaching the summit, the fog took over the summit. We reached the top, took a summit photo and continued towards Grießscharte. We were afraid the weather could change later in the afternoon (at least that is what the forecast said).   This ridge walk is less crowded, we only met few hikers (if you compare it to Alpspitze trails). It is well marked, but you can just follow the trail without problems. This was the best part of the day. Just us enjoying the sun that appeared out of clouds and the views towards Zugspitze. The entire Jubileumgrat is in front of us. This can be one of the goals for the next season.   We descended via Mathaisenkar. It is another B/C ferrata trail, leading to Höllental valley. It’s well secured, only few spots are airy. We were looking forward to the Höllentalanger hut to rest. There were lot of tourists coming from Garmisch via Höllentalklamm.   We continued via Höllentalklamm back to Garmisch. There is an entrace fee (we noticed the sign later on the way down). Höllentalklamm is another highlight of the day. We arrived back to our car 10 hours later. We were exhausted but full of excitment that we finally went up to Alpspitze.

        "title": "Allgäu: Tegelberg - Säuling 2 days hike - Oct 20",
        "excerpt":"We did not spend many night at the huts this year, the last time I was in Ester mountains for a weekend. Therefore we started looking if something was available, a hut somewhere where we have not been yet. We found Fritz-Putz Hütte, it has online booking system so we could easily find some available places. The location is perfect, in Allgäu mountains. We visited the area once to see one of the most famous castles, Neuschwanstein. Athough it turned out that the castle was not our cup of tea (a story for another day).   We started early on Saturday. The hike starts at Tegelberg lift station. Note, the parking there is time limited as you are not supposed to park overnight (22h-6h). We started ascending via the trail that is also for skitouring. It goes through Rohrkopfhütte and Tegelberghaus. We had a short break at Tegelberghaus. The sun was shining and we were enjoying a very warm day at the end of October.   From Tegelberghaus, we continued to Branderschrofen. This is just a small detour worth taking, with small scrambling to the peak’s top. We continued towards the hut. We reached one more peak along the way, Ahornspitze. The views are pretty spectacular and before we knew it, we were planning future trips. From Ahornspitze, we started descending to Bleckenaustraße, which leads to the Fritz-Putz Hut. The hut was renovated and it provides everything a hiker needs.   Second day we continued to Säuling, Danka decided to have a rest day. The trial to Säuling starts directly from the hut and traverses to the peak. Somehow we managed to get pg the trial but then found our way back, by ascending 50 vertical meters. We scrambled through the dry stream back to the trail. A rocky section starts by the end of the traverse. There are fixed ropes and one or two ladders, nothing exposed or difficult. There was only one fellow hiker that we have encountered along the hike.   The descended lead to Säulinghaus (again fixed ropes, plenty of rocks) which was unfortunately closed so we continued towards Neuschwanstein. From the Säulinghaus, it’s just easy hike back to the car, basically a descent through the forest back to the castle and then down to the village.

        "title": "Chiemgau Alps: Staufen ridge hike - Nov 20",
        "excerpt":"The Zwiesel-Hochstaufen ridge is visible when driving from Salzburg to Munich from the highway. It is imposant long ridge through a couple of peaks. I wanted to sleep over at the Reichenhaller Haus this year but due to the restriction it is not possible currently. We decided to complete the hike just in one day.   Our day started at 7 am at Adlgaß parking lot. It was almost empty at this time. The hike starts with traversing below Gamsknogel to reach Kohleralm. Berchtesgadener Alps are in front of us. However, all the valleys around are covered by fog. What a contrast! We continued from Kohleralm to Gamsknogel and we reached its peak shortly after, 2 hours from our hike start. While we are having a break, we are looking ahead at the ridge and guessing where the hiking trail leads.   From this moment, we are on the ridge trail through multiple peaks. There are very few fixed ropes. The second main peak of the day is Zwiesel. Hochstaufen is visible from here in its beauty. The next in line is Zennonkopf, reachable within a couple of minutes. From Zennonkopf, there are good views back to the ridge we already did and the one that follows to Hochstaufen. Roßkarscharte is an interesting section as there is a scrambling part with some fixed ropes.   We took a short break at Mittelstaufen. There are paragliders with us here, they are waiting for good conditions here as well. There are much more hikers as the trail from Bad Reichentall connects right below Mittelstaufen. Our steps continued to Hochstaufen, we were greeting too many people. There were about 30 hikers at the top of Hochstaufen resting. Resting at the top did not make much sense so we rather descended dozens of meters down to avoid the crowds.   The descent back to Adlgaß goes through rocky terrain, we were losing meters very quickly. Once we reached the forest, the trail became wider and it was just about to return back to the parking lot. We managed to return while there was still light. The parking lot was completely full compared to the morning when we started.

        "title": "Karwendel: Bayerkarspitze ridge hike - Nov 20",
        "excerpt":"Time for another ridge hike! Our tour started at the parking lot near Oswaldhütte, Karwendel. Be warned about parking only in designed areas as this is nature park. We parked along the road first behind other cars but a ranger gave us a friendly warning while he was passing by.   The first summit is about 2:30 hours away from the parking lot. From the first summit, the trail continues along the ridge and almost constantly up and down. The trail is easy to follow, wide most of the time (at least in the first half, once it becomes more rocky, it gets more narrow). We continued to Fermerskopf where you can see much further ahead. We finally spotted Krapfenkarspitze, our highest peak. First thought how to get to the top, will it go via that ridge or we go around?   The trail started to be more interesting as we were approaching Krapfenkarspitze. We initially lost a trail right below the summit so we had to scramble a bit through the rocks. The trail was actually going around these rocks. It took us 6 hours to reach the highest point of the day. The summit is quite spacious, we took a longer break to enjoy the Karwendel scenery and rest. We reached one more summit (Gumpenkarspitze).   We descended down to Jägersruh saddle. The way back goes below the summits we just reached. It is quite nice traverse through the woods. The trail looks unused much, destroyed sometimes or just abandoned. There are some challenging parts that were waiting for us. The trail just vanished due to rock fall or water made its marks. We jumped from one part to another or carefully stepped through narrow sandy residues. We got back to our car after almost 10 hours just before it got completely dark.   This was a beautiful ridge, worth doing in the opposite direction the next time with more peaks if we can.

        "title": "Schliersee: Huberspitz trails mtb - June 21",
        "excerpt":"We had limited time the previous weekend, we were looking for shorter ride. Schliersee offers couple of shorther trails like Huberspitz trails.   You need to climb to Almbad Huberspitz first. We stopped for a minute and we continued further about 1 kilometer to get to the starting point for the busline trail. There’s bigger open area with a small wooden open structure (looks like a bus stop). The trail starts with smaller uphil section and then just goes down all the way to the Hausham. There are few difficult spots, mainly due to recent rains although as I read most of the days it is muddy. I would rate this as S2. Few branches or smaller trees were layed down crossing the trail. Someone intentionally place them there.   The second round starts by climbing again the same way up, this time we stop at Almbad Huberspitz. The hut was closed eventhough it was Sunday afternoon and it should be opened (no reason give, just it’s closed).   The second trail is easy way down via 682a path (rated as S1). We met locals at the trail beginning who told us this path will be closed for bikers soon. There were no signs at the moment but as we heard and later read online, it was decide to be for hikers only and the signs will come soon (June 2021).
